Several complaints mention being pushed into forbearance without understanding that interest would continue to grow, making repayment more difficult over time.\\n\\n2. **Systemic Servicing Issues and Poor Communication:** Many borrowers experienced mishandling by loan servicers, such as unnotified transfers, incorrect account statuses, or delayed notices, which led to unintentional delinquency. For example, some complaints describe loans being reported as delinquent without proper notice or confirmation, impacting credit scores.\\n\\n3. **Interest Accumulation and Loan Management Practices:** The continued accumulation of interest during forbearance or deferment extended the time, and increased amount owed, making it harder to pay off the loans. Several complainants felt misled about the true cost and state of their debt due to compounded interest and lack of transparency.\\n\\n4. **Economic Hardship and Unmanageable Payments:** Borrowers faced financial hardships, including unemployment, medical issues, and low wages, which made it impossible to afford the high payments required either due to increased interest or inflexible repayment plans. For some, the only offered solutions—like increased monthly payments—were unaffordable, leading to default or missed payments.\\n\\n5. **Bad Customer Service and Mismanagement:** In some cases, complaints cite unhelpful or dismissive service representatives, misreporting of account status, or failure to provide proper notice of missed payments, which contributed both to nonpayment and credit damage.\\n\\n6. **Misleading or Coercive Practices:** Several complaints accuse servicers of \"forbearance steering,\" where borrowers were repeatedly placed into forbearance instead of being informed about alternative repayment options that could have preserved their credit and reduced their debt effectively. In some instances, borrowers were coerced into consolidation, which increased their loan balances due to interest capitalization.\\n\\nOverall, these issues reflect systemic problems such as poor communication, lack of transparency, and servicing practices that contributed to borrowers’ inability to manage or repay their loans effectively. Many borrowers were not irresponsible; rather, they were often misled or faced insurmountable economic and systemic barriers.'"

        "##### ✅ Answer:\n",
        "\n",
        "Generating multiple reformulations of a user query can improve recall by capturing different ways to express the same intent. When you have just one query, you might miss relevant documents that use different terminology or phrasing. For example, if someone asks \"What are common loan problems?\", the system might only find documents with words like \"loan\" and \"problems\". But by creating multiple reformulations like \"What issues do borrowers face?\", \"What complaints exist about lending?\", and \"What are typical loan difficulties?\", the system can find documents that use synonyms, related terms, or different phrasings.\n",
        "\n",
        "This approach helps because documents in the corpus might describe the same concepts using different vocabulary. Some might say \"borrower complaints\" while others say \"loan issues\" or \"servicing problems\". By searching with multiple query variations, you're more likely to find all the relevant documents, even if they don't use the exact same words as the original query. Think of it like asking the same question in different ways to make sure you don't miss anything important."

        "\n",
        "1. Each un-split \"document\" will be designated as a \"parent document\" (You could use larger chunks of document as well, but our data format allows us to consider the overall document as the parent chunk)\n",

        "3. We will chunk each of those documents into smaller documents, and associate them with their respective parents, and store those in a VectorStore. We'll call those \"child chunks\".\n",
        "4. When we query our Retriever, we will do a similarity search comparing our query vector to the \"child chunks\".\n",
        "5. Instead of returning the \"child chunks\", we'll return their associated \"parent chunks\".\n",
