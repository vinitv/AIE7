In today's assignment, we'll be creating Synthetic Data, and using it to benchmark (and improve) a LCEL RAG Chain.

- ü§ù Breakout Room #1
  1. Task 1: Installing Required Libraries
  2. Task 2: Set Environment Variables
  3. Task 3: Synthetic Dataset Generation for Evaluation using Ragas
  4. Task 4: Evaluating our Pipeline with Ragas
  5. Task 6: Making Adjustments and Re-Evaluating

- ü§ù Breakout Room #2
  1. Task 1: Building a ReAct Agent with Metal Price Tool
  2. Task 2: Implementing the Agent Graph Structure
  3. Task 3: Converting Agent Messages to Ragas Format
  4. Task 4: Evaluating Agent Performance using Ragas Metrics
     - Tool Call Accuracy
     - Agent Goal Accuracy  
     - Topic Adherence

## Ship üö¢

The completed notebook!

<details>
<summary>üöß Advanced Build üöß (OPTIONAL - <i>open this section for the requirements</i>)</summary>

> NOTE: Completing this challenge will provide full marks on the assignment, regardless of the completion of the notebook. You do not need to complete this in the notebook for full marks.

##### **MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS**:

1. Baseline `LangGraph RAG` Application using `NAIVE RETRIEVAL`
2. Baseline Evaluation using `RAGAS METRICS`
  - [Faithfulness](https://docs.ragas.io/en/stable/concepts/metrics/faithfulness.html)
  - [Answer Relevancy](https://docs.ragas.io/en/stable/concepts/metrics/answer_relevance.html)
  - [Context Precision](https://docs.ragas.io/en/stable/concepts/metrics/context_precision.html)
  - [Context Recall](https://docs.ragas.io/en/stable/concepts/metrics/context_recall.html)
  - [Answer Correctness](https://docs.ragas.io/en/stable/concepts/metrics/answer_correctness.html)
3. Implement a `SEMANTIC CHUNKING STRATEGY`.
4. Create an `LangGraph RAG` Application using `SEMANTIC CHUNKING` with `NAIVE RETRIEVAL`.
5. Compare and contrast results.

##### **SEMANTIC CHUNKING REQUIREMENTS**:

Chunk semantically similar (based on designed threshold) sentences, and then paragraphs, greedily, up to a maximum chunk size. Minimum chunk size is a single sentence.

Have fun!
