# A2A Protocol Implementation with LangGraph

This session focuses on implementing the **A2A (Agent-to-Agent) Protocol** using LangGraph, featuring intelligent helpfulness evaluation and multi-turn conversation capabilities.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this session, you'll understand:

- **🔄 A2A Protocol**: How agents communicate and evaluate response quality

## 🧠 A2A Protocol with Helpfulness Loop

The core learning focus is this intelligent evaluation cycle:

```

# Build 🏗️

Complete the following tasks to understand A2A protocol implementation:

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Setup and run
./quickstart.sh
```

```bash
# Start LangGraph server
uv run python -m app
```

```bash
# Test the A2A Serer
uv run python app/test_client.py
```

### 🏗️ Activity #1:

Build a LangGraph Graph to "use" your application.

Do this by creating a Simple Agent that can make API calls to the 🤖Agent Node above through the A2A protocol. 

### ❓ Question #1:

What are the core components of an `AgentCard`?

### ❓ Question #2:

Why is A2A (and other such protocols) important in your own words?

### 🚧 Advanced Build:

<details>
<summary>🚧 Advanced Build 🚧 (OPTIONAL - <i>open this section for the requirements</i>)</summary>

Use a different Agent Framework to **test** your application.

Do this by creating a Simple Agent that acts as different personas with different goals and have that Agent use your Agent through A2A. 

Example:

"You are an expert in Machine Learning, and you want to learn about what makes Kimi K2 so incredible. You are not satisfied with surface level answers, and you wish to have sources you can read to verify information."
