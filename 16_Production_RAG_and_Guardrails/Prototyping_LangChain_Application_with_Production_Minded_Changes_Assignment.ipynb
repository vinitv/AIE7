        "\n",
        "What are some limitations you can see with this caching approach? When is this most/least useful for production systems? \n",
        "\n",
        "Consider:\n",
        "- **Memory vs Disk caching trade-offs**\n",
        "- **Cache invalidation strategies** \n",
        "- **Concurrent access patterns**\n",
        "- **Cache size management**\n",
        "- **Cold start scenarios**\n",

        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "##### ✅ Answer:\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Memory vs Disk Caching Trade-offs:**\n",
        "- **Memory caching** is fast but volatile (lost on restart) and limited by RAM\n",
        "- **Disk caching** persists but has slower I/O and potential file system bottlenecks\n",
        "- Current approach uses in-memory caching which doesn't scale across multiple instances\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Cache Invalidation Strategies:**\n",
        "- **No TTL (Time-To-Live)** - stale data persists indefinitely\n",
        "- **No cache versioning** - model updates don't invalidate old embeddings\n",
        "- **No selective invalidation** - can't clear specific cache entries\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Concurrent Access Patterns:**\n",
        "- **Race conditions** - multiple processes accessing same cache simultaneously\n",
        "- **Cache corruption** - parallel writes to disk cache can corrupt data\n",
        "- **Lock contention** - synchronization overhead in multi-threaded environments\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Cache Size Management:**\n",
        "- **No size limits** - cache can grow indefinitely and consume all memory/disk\n",
        "- **No LRU eviction** - no strategy to remove least recently used items\n",
        "- **Memory leaks** - cache never shrinks, only grows\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Cold Start Scenarios:**\n",
        "- **Empty cache penalties** - first requests always slow\n",
        "- **Cache warming strategies** - no pre-population of frequently used items\n",
        "- **Gradual performance degradation** - performance varies based on cache state\n",
        "\n",
        "### **When Most/Least Useful:**\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Most Useful:**\n",
        "- **Repeated queries** with identical text\n",
        "- **Development/testing** environments with limited scale\n",
        "- **Single-instance deployments** without horizontal scaling needs\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Least Useful:**\n",
        "- **High-throughput production** with diverse queries\n",
        "- **Multi-instance deployments** (cache not shared)\n",
        "- **Frequently changing data** sources requiring fresh embeddings\n",

        "##### ❓ Question #2: Agent Architecture Analysis\n",
        "\n",
        "Compare the Simple Agent vs Helpfulness Agent architectures:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **When would you choose each agent type?**\n",
        "   - Simple Agent advantages/disadvantages\n",
        "   - Helpfulness Agent advantages/disadvantages\n",
        "\n",
        "   ##### ✅ Answer:\n",
        "\n",
        "   Simple Agent is ideal for high-throughput scenarios where speed and cost matter more than perfect responses. It executes in a single pass with predictable latency and lower costs, making it perfect for basic Q&A systems or cost-sensitive applications. However, it lacks quality control and can't self-correct when responses are suboptimal.\n",
        "\n",
        "   Helpfulness Agent excels in customer-facing applications and complex reasoning tasks where response quality is critical. It uses self-evaluation and iterative refinement to produce better responses, but this comes at the cost of 2-3x higher latency and increased LLM usage due to evaluation loops.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Production Considerations:**\n",
        "   - How does the helpfulness check affect latency?\n",
        "   - What are the cost implications of iterative refinement?\n",
        "   - How would you monitor agent performance in production?\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "   ##### ✅ Answer:\n",
        "   The helpfulness check significantly impacts both latency and costs. While Simple Agents make roughly one LLM call per query, Helpfulness Agents typically require 2-4 calls for evaluation and refinement, directly affecting operational expenses. In production, you'd want to monitor response quality metrics alongside performance indicators like P95 latency and token usage. The key is finding the right balance between quality and efficiency based on your specific use case.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Scalability Questions:**\n",
        "   - How would these agents perform under high concurrent load?\n",
        "   - What caching strategies work best for each agent type?\n",
        "   - How would you implement rate limiting and circuit breakers?\n",
        "\n",
        "   ##### ✅ Answer:\n",
        "\n",
        "   Under high concurrent load, Simple Agents scale more predictably due to their linear execution pattern, while Helpfulness Agents face more complex scaling challenges because of their iterative nature. Smart caching becomes crucial - Simple Agents benefit from caching tool results and final responses, while Helpfulness Agents can cache evaluation results and refinement patterns. Implementing rate limiting per user and circuit breakers for tool failures helps maintain system stability.\n",
        "   \n",
        "   Production Recommendation: Use a hybrid approach where Simple Agents handle basic queries and Helpfulness Agents tackle complex or critical requests, with intelligent routing based on query complexity and user importance.\n",

        "**📋 Requirements:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Create a Guardrails Node**: \n",
        "   - Implement input validation (jailbreak, topic, PII detection)\n",
        "   - Implement output validation (content moderation, factuality)\n",
        "   - Handle guard failures gracefully\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Integrate with Agent Workflow**:\n",
        "   - Add guards as a pre-processing step\n",
        "   - Add guards as a post-processing step  \n",
        "   - Implement refinement loops for failed validations\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Test with Adversarial Scenarios**:\n",
        "   - Test jailbreak attempts\n",

        "   - Test inappropriate content generation\n",
        "   - Test PII leakage scenarios\n",

        "**🎯 Success Criteria:**\n",
        "- Agent blocks malicious inputs while allowing legitimate queries\n",
        "- Agent produces safe, factual, on-topic responses\n",
        "- System gracefully handles edge cases and provides helpful error messages\n",
        "- Performance remains acceptable with guard overhead\n",
        "\n",
        "**💡 Implementation Hints:**\n",
        "- Use LangGraph's conditional routing for guard decisions\n",
        "- Implement both synchronous and asynchronous guard validation\n",
        "- Add comprehensive logging for security monitoring\n",
