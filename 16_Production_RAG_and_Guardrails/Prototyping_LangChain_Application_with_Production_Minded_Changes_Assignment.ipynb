Payments are typically due no later than 15 days after the due date. Monthly bills, with the payment amount and due date, are usually sent at least 21 days before the due date ([source](https://dfpi.ca.gov/consumers/student-loans/options/)).\n",

For example, if you're paying $500 a month, it would take 12 months to pay off a $5,000 debt, 26 months for a $10,000 debt, and 72 months for a $20,000 debt. These estimates are based on an average credit card interest rate of 21.56% ([source](https://www.creditkarma.com/calculators/credit-cards/debt-repayment)).\n",

            "3. For Medicare overpayments, any approved repayment schedule would run from the approval date. If the provider doesn't respond, interim payments will be withheld starting on the 16th day from the date of the notice, and applied towards the outstanding overpayment balance ([source](https://www.cms.gov/regulations-and-guidance/guidance/manuals/downloads/fin106c04pdf.pdf)).\n",

        "\n",
        "1. **Create a Guardrails Node**: \n",
        "   - Implement input validation (jailbreak, topic, PII detection)\n",
        "   - Implement output validation (content moderation, factuality)\n",
        "   - Handle guard failures gracefully\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Integrate with Agent Workflow**:\n",
        "   - Add guards as a pre-processing step\n",
        "   - Add guards as a post-processing step  \n",
        "   - Implement refinement loops for failed validations\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Test with Adversarial Scenarios**:\n",
        "   - Test jailbreak attempts\n",
        "   - Test off-topic queries\n",
        "   - Test inappropriate content generation\n",
        "   - Test PII leakage scenarios\n",
        "\n",
        "**🎯 Success Criteria:**\n",
        "- Agent blocks malicious inputs while allowing legitimate queries\n",
        "- Agent produces safe, factual, on-topic responses\n",
        "- System gracefully handles edge cases and provides helpful error messages\n",
        "- Performance remains acceptable with guard overhead\n",
        "\n",
        "**💡 Implementation Hints:**\n",
        "- Use LangGraph's conditional routing for guard decisions\n",
        "- Implement both synchronous and asynchronous guard validation\n",
        "- Add comprehensive logging for security monitoring\n",
