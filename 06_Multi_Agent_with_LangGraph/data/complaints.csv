However, payments were not re-amortized on my federal student loans currently serviced by Nelnet until very recently. The new payment amount that is effective starting with the XX/XX/XXXX payment will nearly double my payment from {$180.00} per month to {$360.00} per month.

My income is approximately $ XXXX/year, which is below 150 % of the federal poverty guideline. Under the SAVE Plan or any valid IDR/IBR plan , this income level qualifies for a $ XXXX monthly payment. 

Instead, Aidvantage assigned me a $ XXXX/month paymentan amount that is not legally or mathematically possible based on my income. I contacted them and was placed in a two-month administrative forbearance. After that, they returned with the exact same incorrect payment amount. 

When I pressed for clarification, Aidvantage responded that my IDR application has not been processed yet, even though they had already issued a bill and claimed it was based on a recalculation. This is a clear contradiction. You can not bill a borrower for an IDR plan amount before processing the application. 

Aidvantage has not requested any additional documentation from me. There has been no communication asking for clarification or income verification beyond my original submission.

These accounts include all loanssubsidized, unsubsidized, and Parent PLUSand their continued presence on my report constitutes an egregious violation of federal privacy statutes and consumer protection law. 

It has come to light through extensive reporting and insider disclosures that entities affiliated with or under the operational influence of XXXX XXXX, specifically DOGE-related ventures, gained illegal and unrestricted access to sensitive borrower data stored within Department of Education systems. This information includes the entirety of my student loan file, which is protected under longstanding federal privacy law and explicit contractual obligations governing the use, access, and safeguarding of this data. 

The unauthorized access to my personal and financial records constitutes a direct violation of the Privacy Act of 1974, the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act ( FERPA ), the Higher Education Act, and the Federal Trade Commission Act, among others. In addition, the Department of Education, by failing to prevent such a breach, has defaulted on its contractual duties, materially violating the terms of agreement I entered into as a borrower. As a matter of contract law, this breach voids the contract in its entirety, rendering all outstanding balances unenforceable. The contract is no longer valid and therefore all associated reporting must cease immediately. 

Furthermore, under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, specifically 15 U.S. Code 1681e ( b ), consumer reporting agencies are required to report only information that is complete and verifiable. The data being reported by your bureau in relation to the "" DEPT OF EDUCATION/NELN '' tradeline is now under legal dispute due to illegality of origin and breach of contract. Continued furnishing or reinsertion of this information without legal justification or lawful verification constitutes willful noncompliance with federal law, making your agency liable under 15 U.S. Code 1681n and 1681o for civil damages. 

Nelnet, the loan servicer responsible for these accounts, is equally liable for their role in the breach. As the originating furnisher of this erroneous and contractually voided data, Nelnet must immediately cease all furnishing of student loan information related to my name and render all associated accounts as deleted and paid in full, or otherwise indicate closure in good standing with XXXX balance due. It is unlawful and unconscionable to continue enforcing repayment obligations upon a client whose contractual terms have been breached by the government and its appointed agents. As such, I owe no further amount under any condition, and the record of these accounts must reflect that accordingly. 

Any delay or attempt to obstruct this dispute under the guise of identity verification is hereby nullified. My government-issued identification, including the front and back of my drivers license, my social security verification, and XXXX XXXX statement showing my current address, are all included in the PDF file named XXXX XXXX XXXX' which is already uploaded to the CFPB complaint system.

1. Violation of FERPA ( Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act ) : As a borrower of federally guaranteed student loans, I am entitled to protections under FERPA, which mandates the confidentiality and proper use of my education records. My student loan data, which includes personally identifiable information ( PII ), was handled and shared in ways that violated these protections, especially in light of recent disclosures involving third-party servicers and unauthorized data access. These disclosures were made without my knowledge or explicit consent.

2. Violation of the Higher Education Act of XXXX : The Higher Education Act includes provisions to ensure that student loans are administered fairly and that students rights are protected. The failure to secure my sensitive financial and academic information and the inability to provide transparency and accountability from loan servicers constitutes a violation of the intent and letter of this law. 

3. Violation of the Privacy Act of XXXX : This federal law requires that federal agencies and contractors who collect, maintain, and disseminate personal information do so with explicit safeguards and procedures. My XXXX XXXX information, held and shared by the Department of Education and its contracted servicers, has been subject to data breaches and mishandling, constituting gross violations of this Act. I was not given timely notice or meaningful redress following these breaches.

4. Data Breaches and Mismanagement of Private Information : Multiple reports in recent years, including public disclosures by the Department of Education and its servicing partners, have confirmed breaches and unauthorized access of borrower data, affecting millions of student loan borrowers whose private informationincluding Social Security number, loan balances, repayment history, and other sensitive datahas been compromised.

These breaches, combined with the federal violations listed above, have not only endangered my financial privacy but have also negatively impacted my credit report and mental and emotional well-being. I did not consent to my data being exposed, nor was I provided any reasonable opportunity to prevent or mitigate this damage.

Requested Action : In light of these legal violations and the lack of accountability by the Department of Education and its third-party loan servicers, I formally request the following : 1. A full and permanent discharge of all my federal student loan obligations under the authority of borrower defense and/or violation of federal privacy laws.

2. Immediate removal of all student loan accounts from my credit report, as they are tied to improperly handled and compromised information.

3. A full investigation into how my personal information was shared, stored, and breached.

4. A clear explanation of what steps, if any, have been taken by federal authorities and servicers to address these violations and protect borrowers like me.

04/19/25,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Trouble with how payments are being handled,"To Whom It May Concern, I am writing to express my growing frustration and serious concern regarding EdFinancials continued mishandling of my student loan accountdespite my repeated attempts to resolve the matter with proper documentation and through the appropriate channels.

Last year, I submitted a formal complaint along with verified documentation confirming my continuous enrollment in school, which legally qualifies me for an in-school deferment under federal regulations. In direct contradiction to this, EdFinancial added a {$90.00} charge to my accountan action that is not only unjustified but also unlawful. 

XXXX XXXX University submitted official verification of my enrollment directly to EdFinancial. I am once again attaching that documentation. In addition, I received a federal student loan disbursement as recently as XX/XX/year> and have completed my exit counselingclear indicators that I am actively enrolled and compliant with federal guidelines. 

Despite this, EdFinancial continues to ignore these legally binding facts. Let me be clear : students enrolled at least half-time are entitled to deferment under the law. EdFinancials blatant disregard of this is unacceptable and appears to be a calculated attempt to force borrowers into repayment status in violation of federal policy. This is not just negligenceit mirrors the tactics of a predatory financial institution.

I am also deeply disturbed to discover that EdFinancial has changed the login credentials for my account without my consent. This has effectively locked me out of my account, and your password reset process requires an account numberwhich, ironically, can not be retrieved without logging into the account itself. This creates a closed loop that appears deliberately designed to obstruct borrowers from managing their accounts and to increase the likelihood of default. 

What began as a {$90.00} error has now ballooned into a balance of {$1900.00}, despite the fact that I am still actively enrolled in college. This is not only outrageous, it borders on abuse.

Furthermore, it is worth noting that EdFinancial representatives previously expressed dissatisfaction when I declined to enter repayment while pursuing my graduate degree. Let me be clear : EdFinancial has no authority to dictate when I must repay my loans when I am eligible for deferment. The coercive tactics being employed here are unacceptable.

I am demanding the immediate removal of all erroneous charges and a full correction of my account to reflect my lawful deferment status. If this matter is not resolved without delay, I will be filing a formal complaint with the U.S. Department of Education, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and will also seek legal counsel to explore further action.

This continued mismanagement is not only unethical, it is illegal. I expect a response within 10 business days.

05/14/25,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Trouble with how payments are being handled,"XX/XX/year> Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) Complaint Against TransUnion for Failure to Investigate and Accurately Report XXXX Account Violations of the FCRA and Metro 2 Guidelines Dear CFPB Complaint Review XXXX, I am filing this complaint against TransUnion, LLC for their failure to conduct a meaningful and legally compliant investigation into inaccurate credit reporting regarding my XXXX student loan account. Despite repeated contact and documentation, TransUnion has failed to uphold its obligations under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and industry-standard Metro 2 compliance procedures. 

Background : Over the course of several months, I have submitted multiple disputes and inquiries to TransUnion concerning the accuracy and reporting status of my XXXX account. Despite receiving two vague, non-committal emails from TransUnion stating they are looking into it, there has been no evidence of a proper reinvestigation or corrective action, in direct violation of federal law. 
In addition to contacting TransUnion directly, I have filed formal written complaints and submitted evidence to : The United States Senate and Congressional Representatives The Attorney Generals Office The Consumer Protection Division The U.S. Department of Education, including the Office of General Counsel Federal XXXX Aid ( FSA ) Complaint Center XXXX and TransUnion ( via email and certified mail ) Furthermore, I submitted an application for the Loan Discharge Request ( LDR ) in XX/XX/year>, which has remained in "" review '' status without any decision, updates, or correspondence from XXXX. Despite this pending application, my student loans were allowed to default, severely damaging my credit and causing financial and emotional distress. I received no contact by phone, email, or postal mail notifying me of the default status. 
To date, I have submitted a total of three LDR applications and one formal Discharge application seeking relief. None of these have been responded to or processed properly. Meanwhile, TransUnion continues to report inaccurate and incomplete information about this account without verifying its accuracy or properly documenting the ongoing disputes and discharge requests. 

Legal Violations : XXXX. Failure to Conduct a Reasonable Reinvestigation FCRA 611 ( 15 U.S.C. 1681i ) requires CRAs to conduct a reasonable reinvestigation when a consumer disputes information. TransUnion has failed to comply by providing no detailed response or outcome while continuing to report disputed data. 
2. Failure to Maintain Procedural Accuracy FCRA 607 ( b ) ( 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ) ) TransUnion is required to maintain procedures to ensure maximum possible accuracy of consumer data. Reporting a defaulted XXXX account despite a pending discharge/LDR application demonstrates procedural failure and negligence. 
3. Metro 2 Compliance Violations Under Metro 2 reporting standards, furnishers and CRAs must correctly reflect dispute codes, deferment/forbearance status, and discharge claims. TransUnion has failed to apply the appropriate codes or suppress reporting while the dispute is ongoing. 
4. Negligent and Willful Noncompliance FCRA 616 & 617 ( 15 U.S.C. 1681n, 1681o ) TransUnion has demonstrated both negligence and willful disregard for the law by continuing to report inaccurate information and failing to correct or investigate the errors, despite ample notice Requested Resolution : Immediate reinvestigation of the XXXX account, with full validation of data and detailed documentation of the source. 

Immediate correction or removal of any XXXX tradeline inaccurately reported in violation of the FCRA and Metro 2 guidelines. 

Cease reporting any default status or negative information while Loan Discharge and LDR applications remain pending. 

An official written response from TransUnion outlining their investigation and confirming full compliance with legal obligations. 

Referral or enforcement action by the CFPB for TransUnions consistent failure to follow the FCRA and industry standards. 

TransUnion 's ongoing disregard for procedural accuracy and consumer rights not only violates federal law but causes serious, real-world harm. I am requesting the CFPB hold them fully accountable for their lack of action and require proper investigation and correction.

I did not agree to, nor was I notified of, any legally valid transfer of this debt to the U.S. Small Business Administration ( SBA ), and I believe this situation involves misrepresentation, improper reassignment, and potential violations of my borrower rights. 
Background : My original student loan was executed through a promissory note with the Department of Education, not with the Small Business Administration. 
I have recently discovered that my loan is now being managed or claimed by the SBA, without my consent or a new promissory agreement. 
At no point did I sign a contract or legally binding document with the SBA regarding this debt. 
Additionally, I reference an Executive Order issued under President Donald J. Trump, which effectively dismantled or significantly altered the authority or structure of the Department of Education. If the DoE was disbanded or restructured in a way that invalidates prior agreements or agency authority, that raises legal and constitutional concerns about this loans enforceability under a new agency. 
Dispute and Legal Concerns : I dispute the validity of any attempt to collect on this loan under the SBA. 
I believe the transfer of my student loan without consent violates basic contract law and federal regulations governing student loans. 
This action may also violate the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ), Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), and other applicable consumer protection statutes. 
Requested Actions : 1. I request an immediate investigation into the legality of the loan transfer or reassignment.

2. I request written documentation showing how the loan was legally transferred, including a signed agreement if one exists.

3. I request that all collection efforts by the SBA cease until this dispute is resolved.

4. If this transfer is found to be improper or unlawful, I request the loan be discharged or returned to its original status with the appropriate federal student loan servicing authority.

I appreciate your urgent attention to this matter.

XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX AZ XXXXXXXX SSN : XXXX DOB : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX To : Aidvantage  / Maximus : XXXX  XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX TX XXXXXXXX RE : Dispute of Unverified Student Loan Accounts Immediate Deletion Requested To Whom It May Concern, This letter is a formal dispute submitted in accordance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), 15 U.S.C. 1681 et seq., concerning the reporting of student loan accounts associated with Aidvantage, XXXX on my XXXX credit file. 

1. ISSUE : Lack of Verification of a Signed Master Promissory Note ( MPN ) Relevant Law : Under 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ), a credit reporting agency must conduct a reasonable reinvestigation if a consumer disputes the completeness or accuracy of any item in their file. Additionally, under 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ), the CRA must ensure maximum possible accuracy of the information it includes. 
Demand : I am demanding immediate deletion of the referenced student loan account ( s ) from my XXXX  credit file unless the data furnisher can provide the original, wet-ink signed Master Promissory Note ( MPN ) establishing a valid, enforceable obligation in my name. Electronic reproduction or summary data is not sufficient under federal evidentiary standards, particularly when the debt is disputed. The burden of proof lies with the furnisher. If the original contract does not exist, the tradeline must be removed. 

2. ISSUE : Failure to Verify Current Status Forbearance or Administrative Hold Relevant Law : Per 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2 ( b ), the information furnisher is obligated to investigate disputed information and correct or delete any data found to be inaccurate or unverifiable. If a loan is in administrative forbearance, deferment, or a non-repayment status due to federal policy or executive order, such status must be clearly and accurately reflected in the reporting. Failure to do so constitutes willful misreporting and inaccurate furnishing of information. 
Demand : Please verify whether this account is presently subject to administrative forbearance or any federal hold. If it is, it can not legally be reported as delinquent or in default. If this can not be fully verified and proven by the data furnisher, the account must be removed immediately for failure to meet accuracy and verification standards outlined by the FCRA. 

3. ISSUE : XXXX XXXX and XXXX  Compliance Failure Relevant Law : The XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  ( XXXX  ) XXXX XXXX Format Guidelines, which XXXX has adopted for credit furnishing, require that all tradelines be accurate, complete, and up-to-date. Reporting disputed, unverifiable, or administratively frozen debts violates these guidelines. 
Demand : You are required to remove any entry that does not conform with XXXX XXXX  and XXXX  standards. Student loans that are not contractually verified or are impacted by legislative changes ( such as federal repayment pauses or executive actions ) must not be reported as adverse. If you can not validate this account according to those standards, it must be removed. 

Failure to Comply Will Result in Further Action This is a legal dispute under the FCRA. Should you fail to respond within 30 days with sufficient documentation, I will escalate the matter with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) and consider further legal action under 15 U.S.C. 1681n and 1681o for willful or negligent noncompliance.

I believe my sensitive informationsubmitted through the federal student aid system and managed by these servicersmay have been accessed, disclosed, or mishandled without my consent, in violation of multiple federal laws. 

Specifically, I suspect violations of : FERPA ( Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act ), which protects the confidentiality of my education records ; The Privacy Act of 1974, which restricts federal agencies from disclosing personal information without authorization ; The Higher Education Act, which limits the use of FAFSA data solely to administering aid. 

These suspicions are based on widespread reports of unauthorized access to federal student aid data ( e.g., the Department of Educations DOGE program and past servicer data breaches involving millions of borrowers ). While I have not been officially notified, the scale and nature of these privacy lapses make it entirely plausible that my information was compromised. I never gave written consent for my personal data to be shared with third parties for any purpose beyond the direct servicing of my loan.

04/11/25,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Trouble with how payments are being handled,"Complaint : Drastically increased my monthly payment, not approving IDR applications, and screwing up a refund for four months. 

As of XX/XX/XXXX my student loan balance was {$36000.00}, and I was making {$200.00} monthly payments for years. I went back to school in XX/XX/XXXX and went on In-School Deferment.

In-School Deferment sends XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX XXXX = {$50000.00}. 

Only a few days before XX/XX/XXXX, Aidvantage says I have {$750.00} due on that day as my first payment. Begrudgingly I pay via XXXX as I don't want my count to go delinquent. I call Aidvantage and ask why this amount is so large compared to what I am historically used to paying. They have no answer and can't lower it. I apply for SAVE plan at this time. They confirmed I provided all documents and just need to wait for approval. They do NOT put me on another forbearance due to my application. 

XX/XX/XXXX I get an email notification saying my account is delinquent, and that I owe {$240.00} right now, despite paying {$750.00} via XXXX, and balance owed was XXXX just XXXX days prior. I manually pay {$240.00}, and then I call in an ask why this happened. They have no answer and never give me an answer. 

XX/XX/XXXX I pay {$750.00} again via XXXX, no news on XXXX application status. 

XX/XX/XXXX I pay {$750.00} again via XXXX, no news on SAVE application status. I call in and ask the status of my SAVE application. They can not find my application until I give them specific dates, and miraculously they find my application. They then tell me that they didn't receive any of my require income documentation despite my sending in months prior and being told it all looks good. Because of this, my original application was never considered. I am angry, I provide them with Income docs, and they restart my application. They put me on a two month application forbearance at this time. 

XX/XX/XXXX my forbearance ends. Next day I see I owe now {$980.00} per month starting in THREE DAYS!!! Three days advanced notice of another wild price jump. I immediately cancel XXXX as I do not trust it due to earlier problems. I manually pay {$980.00} and it is applied to my account on the XX/XX/XXXX due date. However, also on XX/XX/XXXX, Aidvantage takes {$760.00} from my bank account via XXXX, despite cancelling XXXX a week prior!!! So now they have a total of {$1700.00} payment from me for month of XX/XX/XXXX. 

I call Aidvantage and complain. It takes XXXX minutes into the call before they even admit to the mistake. I tell them to use that extra payment and apply it to my future account so that I do not owe for next month. They say this is acceptable. 

XX/XX/XXXX I notice the {$760.00} completely disappears from my "" Recent Payments '' section in Aidvantage XXXX. Confuse, I call in and they tell me a refund has been issued for {$760.00}. I complain that I didn't want a refund, and they ignored me, but then I say "" whatever '', I will wait for this refund. 

XX/XX/XXXX my account updates saying my next payment is due on XX/XX/XXXX, and that it is for {$400.00}. I manually pay this amount. Completely frustrated, I call into Aidvantage and ask again for the status of my refund, AND I ask for the status of my SAVE Plan application. They say applications aren't processing right now. As for my refund, they say the original ticket was put in incorrectly and the refund was never issued. They escalate the ticket at this time and I am told the {$760.00} refund process is starting over. 

XX/XX/XXXX my account page updates in Aidvantage saying that my next payment is {$960.00}, due on XX/XX/XXXX. 

I am angry at this point and say I don't care about the SAVE plan anymore, and ask if there is another IDR plan they are accepting applications for at this time? I'm told I can try the ICR plan which would bring my monthly payment down to {$600.00} a month. I tell them to cancel my SAVE Plan application, and start a new application for ICR Plan. I provide all of my documents. They put me on a two month NON-interest accruing forbearance while this application is being reviewed. 

XX/XX/XXXX, I get notification that my account has update, but instead of my account page saying that I owe {$0.00} for XX/XX/XXXX, I am instead now delinquent and that I owe {$6.00} due NOW. I manually pay this amount. 

XX/XX/XXXX my account page says that I owe {$0.00} on XX/XX/XXXX and XXXX XXXX is XXXX. I do have a new XXXX though saying my forbearance is ending XX/XX/XXXX. No refund received yet for {$760.00}. 

XX/XX/XXXX my account page says that I owe {$0.00} on XX/XX/XXXX and XXXX XXXX is XXXX. I do have a new XXXX though saying my forbearance is ending XX/XX/XXXX. No refund received yet for {$760.00}. 

XX/XX/XXXX ( today ) I call Aidvantage. I tell them I still have not received my {$760.00} refund which was first initiated XX/XX/XXXX. They research my tickets and now tell me the original refund ticket was put in for {$400.00}, which is wrong. I told them this is not true, otherwise why did {$760.00} disappear from my recent payments. It was clearly approved for refund. The Aidvantage representative can not tell me why the refund hasn't been completed yet, and that they are putting in another escalation for this today, with a processing estimate of another XXXX to XXXX weeks. 

I also ask the representative for the status of my new XXXX plan application. She tells me that all ICR applications are not being reviewed right now. I say "" Wait, I was TOLD on XX/XX/XXXX that ICR plans ARE being reviewed, and this is the entire reason I cancelled my SAVE plan applcation in the first place. Now I'm being told that this is not true, and that ALL Income-driven repayment plans are on pause, not just SAVE. I was either lied to or given false information, and this caused me to cancel my SAVE application that had been in processing for six months.

I am ALSO now told that the two-month non-interest accruing forbearance I was put on these past two month is ACTUALLY an interest accruing forbearance. Another lie told to me on XX/XX/XXXX. 

The current representative tells me that my next payment is due XX/XX/XXXX, but she can not tell me how much it will be. She said the system will automatically put me in forbearance if my newer XXXX plan application hasn't been approved yet, but I know this is a lie. It has never done this before. I'm told if it doesn't do it automatically, that I should call them a week before the XXXX payment is due. 

Based on history pattern, I fully expect my XX/XX/XXXX payment to now be even HIGHER, and it won't appear on my account until a couple days before it is due.

A major factor, we believe, for the communication problem was that the manager of our loan switched from XXXX to NelNet & Nelnet is now servicing the loan.

We changed our email in XXXX and were not using the previous email that XXXX had. Additionally, if NelNet called my phone number I likely did not answer because I had no idea who it was and according to NelNet they were using a dialer and never left messages. 

It seems NelNet did the bare minimum to attempt to contact me to let me know they were the new servicing agency ( never called and left a message, never sent a piece of mail ) and that the loan process had started back up from Covid. Now they have damaged my credit. NelNet said there was nothing they could do to change the credit report and seemed to not care much about ruining someone's credit. Additionally, they were pretty rude in how they handled it. 

I understand, as they said, that it was my responsibility to let them know my email had changed, however it had been over 3 years since the last payment was due and it seems only reasonable to understand things change and more could have been done to assist in communication. 

As soon as I knew the loans were considered in default I paid the amount due. Additionally, I had never made a late payment in all the time I had the loans. I strongly believe that with the unusual circumstances surrounding Covid and the stopping and starting of the loans over a significant period of time, that now that I understand they have begun again, I should be granted some grace. I would sincerely appreciate it if the report to the credit agency could be removed as I have not had a late payment or problem with my credit for over 20 years.

04/15/25,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Incorrect information on your report,Account status incorrect,"To Whom It May Concern, On XX/XX/year>, I experienced a significant and devastating drop in my credit scores : from approximately XXXX to XXXX on Experian, and from XXXX to XXXX on TransUnion. As a XXXX individual who has spent my entire adult life building and maintaining strong credit, this sudden decline has been not only financially damaging but also deeply disheartening. 

Prior to these recent Department of Education loan reports, my credit history was overwhelmingly positive, marked by over 99 % of on-time payments with only a few isolated XXXX  days past due occurrences, each of which were accidental and never reflective of an unwillingness to meet my obligations. I have consistently chosen to carry loans and pay extended interest to build and preserve my credit. This recent event has left me feeling utterly defeated, with the prospect of spending the next XXXX years working to rebuild my score seeming nearly insurmountable. 

In the past week, Ive read hundreds, if not thousands of testimonies from others who are enduring the exact same hardship. It is clear that this issue is not the result of individual negligence, but rather the consequence of a systemic breakdown impacting people nationwide. 

Before this change, I had approximately {$96000.00} in available credit card lines, of which only about 2 % was utilized. Now, with my credit scores severely affected, my available credit has been slashed to nearly nothing. As a result, I am currently unable to secure financing for a vehicle, a home, or any other need that depends on a functional credit score. 

The student loans in question were placed in forbearance while I pursued XXXX XXXX ( becoming a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ) and during the federal Covid-related pause. During this time, the loans were transferred to Nelnet and fragmented into XXXX separate accounts. Despite my efforts, including submitting paperwork on multiple occasions during the forbearance period and calling and talking to representatives, I was unable to complete the consolidation process or establish a manageable repayment plan. Importantly, these loans remained in forbearance throughout this time. 

Following the credit report changes on XX/XX/XXXX, I was finally able to speak with a representative at Nelnet, who graciously assisted in placing the loans back into forbearance ( after which they had been removed to forbearance without me understanding what was going on ) to allow time for consolidation and payment setup. I want to emphasize that I have never had the intention to avoid repaying any debt I owe or any debt I've ever owed. My long-standing credit record serves as a testament to that commitment. 

To characterize this situation as frustrating would be a gross understatement. The complexity and opacity of the current loan servicing and credit reporting system are overwhelming even to the most diligent and responsible individuals. There is a clear and urgent need for reform. I am incredibly grateful for the opportunity to have received student loans, as they allowed me to pursue an education that would not have been possible otherwise. I did not have familial financial support, and without a degree, I would never have had access to a job that could support repayment or my family entirely. 

However, many of us who have tried to do everything right now find ourselves in crisis. The system, as it stands, is failing the very people it was meant to empower, hardworking individuals striving to better themselves and contribute meaningfully to our country. We need help.

04/16/25,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Incorrect information on your report,Account status incorrect,"Formal Complaint Against Aidvantage  Unfair Reporting of Delinquency and Credit Damage To whom it may concern, I am filing this complaint in regard to a serious issue involving Aidvantages  handling of my federal student loans, specifically their decision to report my account as XXXX days delinquentresulting in a devastating drop of over XXXX points to my credit score. I believe this was an unfair and avoidable outcome, driven not by legal necessity but by rigid internal policy and an unwillingness to exercise discretion or provide reasonable assistance. 

Due to Aidvantages own system restrictions, the XXXX application portal was inaccessible throughout much of XXXX and XX/XX/year>. I was XXXX XXXX from my XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/year>, and immediately took steps to stabilize my financial situation. On XX/XX/year>, the very first day the system allowed it, I submitted my Income-Driven Repayment ( IDR ) application through XXXX. On XX/XX/year>, I received an official email from Aidvantage  confirming my account had been placed into forbearance. On XX/XX/year>, I received another message confirming that my account was in good standing. 

Despite all of this, Aidvantage  still reported multiple accounts as XXXX days delinquent as of XX/XX/XXXX, just one day before I was able to act. The result : severe and immediate damage to my credit profile, despite my proactive effort to resolve the matter as quickly as possible. 

This punishment is not based on financial misconduct or unwillingness to payit is a technicality. I have made clear to Aidvantage  that I am fully willing to set up payment arrangements or resolve any past-due balance, if one exists. Instead, I was told that they can not remove the delinquency because of the way their system locks in reporting at the end of the monthnot because they are legally prohibited from doing so, but because their policy will not allow it. I have even spoken with representatives at credit bureaus who confirmed that loan servicers do have discretion to retract negative reporting under certain circumstances. 

I am now facing serious, life-altering consequences : I have sold my car in preparation for a XX/XX/XXXX relocation to XXXX, XXXX  to start a XXXX  XXXX. 

With my credit score drastically lowered, I am unable to secure a new auto loan or be approved for an apartment. 

Without transportation or housing, I may be unable to begin employment, jeopardizing both my income and long-term financial stability. 

All I am asking for is fairness. My loans are currently in forbearance and reflect good standing. I acted in good faith the moment I was able. The delinquency status and its devastating impact on my credit are not representative of my intent, character, or current account status. 

I respectfully request that Aidvantage  retract the XXXX delinquency reporting, as it does not align with the broader context of this situation, nor with the flexibility I believe they are capable of exercising.

Account Name : [ Name listed on report or Dept of Education/NELN ] Account Number : XXXX Date Opened : XX/XX/XXXX Reported Balance : {$3800.00} Original Balance : {$3000.00} Issue : This account reflects a balance that exceeds the original loan amount, and also shows a last payment date and balance update from XX/XX/XXXX, which is inaccurate as the account is currently in deferment with payments not due until XX/XX/XXXX. Furthermore, the school connected to this loan is now permanently closed. This may qualify the loan for discharge and should be investigated for accuracy in reporting. 



2. Account Name : DEPT OF EDUCATION/NELN Account Number : XXXX Date Opened : XX/XX/XXXX Reported Balance : {$2200.00} Original Balance : {$1700.00} Issue : Similar to the previous account, this loan balance exceeds the original amount and includes recent payment activity reporting that is inconsistent with its deferred status.

XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing to file a formal complaint regarding my student loans, as I am currently coming out of forbearance and have noticed some troubling discrepancies with my loan balances and interest rates. 

Over the years, my loans have been sold several times, which I understand may contribute to some of the confusion surrounding my account. However, I am concerned about the substantial increases in interest rates that I have seen on some of my loans. When I originally took out the loans, the interest rates were set at a standard percentage. However, it appears that these rates have significantly increased, which I believe is unfair and potentially in violation of the original terms of my loan agreements. 

Given the financial strain I have faced in trying to keep up with payments, especially during and after forbearance, it is disheartening to see the interest rates skyrocketing and my balances growing despite my efforts to make payments. I find this situation to be unfair, and I believe that my loans should be handled in accordance with the terms originally agreed upon, without unjustified increases in interest. 

I respectfully request that the CFPB investigate my loans and help ensure that my balances and interest rates are accurate. I am also seeking guidance on what steps I can take to resolve this matter with my loan servicer.",None,"Maximus Federal Services, Inc.",NV,89148,Older American,Consent provided,Web,04/30/25,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,13178964

This instrument, presented in good faith, constituted a remittance to satisfy the outstanding obligation under contract and commercial law principles. Despite confirmation of receipt, Nelnet has willfully refused to settle the account and continues to report it as delinquent, leading to a significant drop in my credit score of over XXXX points. This is not merely a servicing error it is a knowing, reckless, and fraudulent act. 

Nelnets continued reporting and collection activity directly violates the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( XXXX U.S.C. XXXX et seq. ) and the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( XXXX U.S.C. XXXX ), as well as the Department of Educations own borrower servicing guidelines. Their refusal to correct the record despite evidence of settlement constitutes willful misrepresentation of the accounts status. 

Moreover, this conduct amounts to fraudulent accounting under multiple sections of the ASC ( Accounting Standards Codification ), specifically : ASC 450 ( Contingencies ) : Nelnet has failed to disclose or account for contingent liabilities created by federal guarantees or potential reimbursements tied to the loan. 

ASC 860 ( Transfers and Servicing ) : If the loan was sold or securitized, it should have been derecognized from Nelnets books ; continued collection represents a second monetization of an already-settled asset. 

ASC 942 ( Financial Services - Depository and Lending ) : Nelnet has not provided full servicing disclosures, nor acknowledged its role in collecting on an account it may no longer own, which is materially misleading to both the borrower and the federal government. 

These failures, combined with inaccurate credit reporting and the ongoing damage to my financial standing, are causing irreparable harm and deserve immediate federal intervention. I am requesting that the CFPB investigate this matter thoroughly and coordinate, if necessary, with the U.S. Department of Education, the Office of Inspector General, and the SEC to enforce compliance with accounting regulations, consumer protection laws, and to compel Nelnet to reflect the account as settled, paid in full, and never late.

My college was included in the instant loan forgiveness/discharge/decision group. 

My loans were originally with XXXX and were moved to Mohela for servicing. Mohela 's website shows a balance of XXXX for each of my discharged loans. The same is true regarding the loan balance reported on studentaid.gov. However, the loans still show on my credit report and I have not received any refunds for payments made toward these loans. 

Regarding my credit report, I submitted a dispute with the credit bureaus and was informed that the dispute would be closed and the loan balance would not be removed from my credit report because Mohela confirmed that a balance still exists on my account. This is inaccurate. 

I have reached out to Mohela several times over the past XXXX plus months, requesting that they update my credit report with accurate balance information. Each representative I spoke with assured me that my credit report would be updated. I also requested some sort of documentation that confirms the discharge occurred and the balance is XXXX. I was assured this would be sent to my email within the next several business days. Nothing was ever changed on my credit report, my credit report still shows the XXXX balance, and I have not received any documentation from Mohela regarding the discharge or my balance. 

I would like the loan balance to be updated on my credit report to reflect accuracy of a XXXX balance.

05/08/25,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Co-signer,"On XX/XX/2020, I endorsed a Direct PLUS Loan for my mother, serviced originally by Nelnet. 

During the federal student loan servicing transition in XXXX, our loan was transferred ( or split ) to XXXX. This was terrible timing as the CARES Act was put into effect on XX/XX/2020 and extended multiple times throughout the years. 

My mother did not receive any notification or correspondence regarding the servicer change, which is required by federal regulations. 

My sister, who was making the payments, was unaware of the transfer and thus missed payments on the portion managed by NelNet. 

These missed payments were reported to the credit bureaus, negatively impacting both my mothers and my credit reports. 

We only became aware of the issue upon reviewing our credit reports. 

My sister immediately set up autopay to bring the accounts current, but the late payments remain on our credit reports. 

As the endorser of this Direct PLUS Loan, I understand that my obligation is to repay the loan if the borrower fails to do so. The Addendum to the Master Promissory Note ( MPN ) that I signed repeatedly states, an endorser is someone who agrees to repay the Direct PLUS Loan if the borrower does not repay the loan. It also specifically notes : If the borrower of a Direct PLUS Loan becomes delinquent in making payments or defaults on the loan, we may also report your name to consumer reporting agencies in connection with the delinquent or defaulted loan. The use of the word may indicates that reporting my name for delinquencies is discretionary, not mandatory.

In my case, the borrower did not default on the loan ; there were only late payments due to a lack of notification during a servicer transition. I was never notified of the delinquency or given an opportunity to bring the account current before negative information was reported on my credit. Given the discretionary nature of reporting as outlined in the MPN, and the fact that I was not afforded a reasonable opportunity to address the situation, I believe it is unfair and inconsistent with the spirit of the agreement to have my credit negatively impacted under these circumstances. 

I have a strong history of on time payments, and if given the chance and proper communication, I would have kept the account status current, thus preventing any delinquency on my credit report as well as my mother 's.",None,"Nelnet, Inc.",NV,89166,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,05/08/25,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,13382732

03/28/25,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Don't agree with the fees charged,"I am submitting this complaint regarding unauthorized interest accrual on my XXXX XXXX XXXX  enrolled in the SAVE ( Saving on a XXXX XXXX ) plan. Despite the Department of Education 's explicit guidance that loans under the SAVE plan should not accrue interest during the administrative forbearance period, Aidvantage has allowed interest to accrue on my account, resulting in an increase in my loan balance. 

Here is a summary of the issue and timeline : Department of Education Guidance : The Department of Education mandated that all borrowers enrolled in the SAVE plan be placed into an interest-free administrative forbearance beginning XX/XX/XXXX, due to ongoing legal challenges. During this period, no interest was supposed to accrue on loans. 

Aidvantage 's Actions : Aidvantage stated in their letter dated XX/XX/XXXX, that my loans were in a general forbearance with no interest accruing from XX/XX/XXXX, through XX/XX/XXXX. 

However, they claim that when I submitted a new Income-Driven Repayment ( IDR ) application on XX/XX/XXXX, my loans were moved into a "" processing forbearance '' for up to 60 days. During this processing forbearance, Aidvantage allowed interest to accrue on my loans starting XX/XX/XXXX, despite my enrollment in the SAVE plan. 

When my application was not processed within the 60-day window, Aidvantage states that my account was moved back into a general forbearance effective XX/XX/XXXX, during which interest was set to 0 %. 

Impact : My loan balance increased from {$72000.00} ( as of XX/XX/XXXX ) to {$73000.00} as of nowa difference of {$1300.00} in unauthorized accrued interest. 

This interest accrual violates the Department of Educations directive that loans under the SAVE plan should not accrue interest during administrative forbearance. 

Attempts to Resolve : I have made over a dozen phone calls to Aidvantage since XX/XX/XXXX, totaling more than 12 hours of time spent trying to resolve this issue. 

During each call, I was promised a supervisor callback within 24-48 business hours, but no supervisor has ever followed up with me. 

I escalated this issue to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB Complaint # XXXX ), but Aidvantage falsely reported to the CFPB that the issue was resolved when it was not. 

Why This Is a Problem : Aidvantages actions are inconsistent with federal regulations and Department of Education mandates regarding the SAVE plan. The Department explicitly stated that borrowers enrolled in SAVE should not accrue interest during administrative forbearance. By allowing interest to accrue during the processing forbearance period ( XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX ), Aidvantage has violated these directives. 

Additionally : Their explanation in their XX/XX/XXXX letter does not align with federal guidance. 

Their failure to follow through on promised callbacks and their false reporting to the CFPB demonstrate systemic issues in their handling of borrower complaints.

What I Am Requesting : Immediate removal of the {$1300.00} in unauthorized accrued interest from my account. 

Restoration of my loan balance to {$72000.00} as it was in XX/XX/XXXX. 

Written confirmation from Aidvantage detailing these corrections and assurances that no further interest will accrue while my account remains under administrative forbearance as mandated by the Department of Education.

Accountability for Aidvantages false reporting to the CFPB and failure to provide adequate customer service. 

A formal investigation into whether Aidvantage is systematically violating Department of Education mandates regarding SAVE plan borrowers.

This issue has caused significant stress and wasted time due to Aidvantages noncompliance and lack of accountability. I request immediate action from both Aidvantage and federal authorities to resolve this matter fairly and ensure compliance with federal regulations moving forward.

05/06/25,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Problem with a company's investigation into an existing problem,Investigation took more than 30 days,"Issue Summary : Servicing failure by Maximus Education XXXX ( XXXX Aidvantage ) led to derogatory credit reporting without borrower notification or account access. Despite full repayment and escalation, Ive received no resolution. 

What Happened? 
Aidvantage reported a late payment to the credit bureaus on a XXXX  student loan in my name, even though I, the legal borrower, was never contacted, never granted account access, and never notified of resumed repayment or delinquency. 

I discovered this only after seeing a XXXX point drop in my credit score, which severely impacted my ability to access business credit. Upon discovery, I immediately : -Paid the loan in full -Updated all contact information -Registered for account access ( for the XXXX  time ever ) -Submitted a formal goodwill adjustment request outlining the servicing failures Aidvantage ignored the core facts, sent XXXX canned responses, and never produced any evidence of contacting me, the borrower. Their only defense was that messages were posted to my "" inbox, '' a portal I couldnt access because I was never given login credentials or account info. 

Servicing Failures ( All Documented ) : -No repayment notice after COVID forbearance ended ( a requirement under federal loan guidelines ) -No billing statements, emails, or delinquency alerts sent to me, only to my parents, despite being the borrower -No opportunity to cure the alleged delinquency prior to credit reporting ( a possible FCRA violation ) -No login credentials or account access ever provided, I could not monitor or pay this account until after the derogatory mark was made -No evidence ever provided by Aidvantage that communication attempts were made to me Federal Oversight Failure : On XX/XX/year>, I submitted a detailed complaint to the XXXX XXXX XXXX Ombudsman Group . Their auto-reply promised a response within XXXX days. 

I received no response. 

On XX/XX/year>, I submitted a second follow-up directly through the XXXX platform. 

It is now XX/XX/year> over XXXX days later and the case is still marked "" In Review '' with no reply. This government silence has left me with no further path to resolution except for this CFPB filing. 

Requested Resolution : I am respectfully asking the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to : -Investigate Aidvantages failure to provide borrower-level communication or account access -Support my request for a Goodwill Adjustment and removal of the derogatory mark from all major credit bureaus -Review the breakdown in oversight and responsiveness from the XXXX XXXX XXXX Ombudsman Group Why This Matters : XXXXI have made every effort in good faith to resolve this without escalation. 

XXXXThe loan was relatively small and has been fully repaid. 

XXXXThe derogatory mark was caused solely by servicer negligence, not borrower behavior.

I consolidated my loans in XX/XX/XXXX to take advantage of the one-time account adjustment and when I consolidated I selected the lowest payment plan which was XXXX. Because of litigation I was automatically placed in a XXXX level repayment plan which I never selected and which isnt XXXX so it wont count towards XXXX. I was initially told I am not not eligible for administrative forbearance because I was never in XXXX XXXX, but that is because of the timing of my application and the only option is for me to keep calling back to extend the forbearance. I also cant enter an XXXX plan even if I want to because there is a processing pause. 
On XX/XX/XXXX a Mohela supervisor extended my forbearance for XXXX year through XX/XX/XXXX so I did not have to call back each month. This helped me avoid making payments on a plan that would not count towards XXXX. I have a recording of this conversation. She also helped me submit a paper application for a new XXXX plan, but said she could not guarantee when this would be processed due to the pause, but in the meanwhile I would be in forbearance so I wouldn't have to worry. I uploaded the paper version of the XXXX application that day. 
Because of my XXXX application, I received a letter from Mohela on XX/XX/XXXX stating that "" We recently received your income-driven repayment ( XXXX ) application, but since a federal court issued an injunction preventing the XXXX XXXX XXXX  ( XXXX ) from operating the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) Plan and other XXXX plans, XXXX application processing is taking longer than normal. 
Due to these delays your XXXX application is in a pending status and MOHELA is putting your account into a forbearance for up to XXXX  days. '' My XXXX  application got denied due to a missing signature ( even though a Mohela supervisor looked over my application and told me it was complete ), so after calling and speaking with another supervisor to determine why my XXXX was denied, I submitted a new XXXX application on XX/XX/XXXX with the signature needed. That supervisor explained that if my application is not approved before my next payment date of XX/XX/XXXX, I can call to be placed on processing forbearance. She understood that I did not want to make payments that were not in an XXXX plan because they would not qualify for XXXX. She said the processing forbearance wont be done automatically, but at that point I can call and ask because theyll see the new XXXX application on file. Unfortunately I have been trying to call to ask and can not get through to anyone because of the outrageously long hold times.

Department of Education ( DOE ) and the Department of Government Efficiency ( DOGE ). This breach constitutes a direct violation of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act ( FERPA ) and Title IV regulations, as well as an egregious violation of my personal privacy and financial security.

I recently discovered that my sensitive and legally protected records were accessed and potentially shared without my consent. This includes but is not limited to : 1. My academic records and personally identifiable information ( PII ).

2. My Free Application for Federal Student Aid ( FAFSA ) data, including financial aid history and loan information.

3. My IRS tax transcripts, which were obtained and used without proper authorization.

These actions violate my rights under FERPA ( 20 U.S.C. 1232g ; 34 CFR Part 99 ), which grants me the right to control access to my educational records, as well as Title IV of the Higher Education Act, which governs the use and protection of federal student aid information. Furthermore, unauthorized access to my IRS tax data raises serious concerns regarding potential identity theft, fraud, and violations of federal data security standards.

Given the severity of this breach and the direct impact on my financial security and privacy, I demand the following corrective actions : 1. Immediate discharge and cancellation of all my federal student loans due to the breach of my financial aid and tax records, which invalidates the integrity of my loan agreements.

2. A formal investigation into this data breach, including details on how my records were accessed, who accessed them, and for what purpose.

3. A full report on the extent of my data exposure and the corrective measures being implemented to prevent future violations.

4. Immediate notification to all major credit bureaus ( XXXX XXXX XXXX, and XXXX XXXX ) to place a fraud alert and investigate any unauthorized activity that may have resulted from this breach.

This breach has caused significant distress and concern regarding the security of my personal and financial data. If my demands are not met within 30 days, I will be left with no choice but to escalate this matter through legal channels, including filing complaints with the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ), the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ), and pursuing legal action against the responsible parties.

I request a written response addressing these concerns and outlining the immediate actions being taken to remedy this situation. Please direct all correspondence to the address listed above.

I applied for and was approved for up to {$20000.00} in loan forgiveness. Based on official guidance and the repeated extensions of the payment pause, I was led to reasonably believe that my balance would be reduced before repayment resumed. 

Following this official direction, I did not make payments, as federal communication indicated no payments were necessary while forgiveness was pending. However, after the program was overturned by the Supreme Court, no alternative relief or adjustment was provided to borrowers like myself who acted in good faith based on government promises. 

As a result, I am now considered behind on my loans, not because of negligence, but because I trusted the guidance given at the time. I feel this situation is extremely unfair and has caused me financial and emotional stress. It has been a major mental and emotional struggle to even motivate myself to repay now, because it feels fundamentally unjust to be penalized for following what the government instructed me to do. 

I respectfully request that my loan account be restored to good standing without penalties or negative credit reporting. Additionally, due to the false hope provided and the harm caused by being placed into delinquency, I am formally requesting that a meaningful percentage of my loan balance be forgiven as compensation for the damage caused.

Despite my timely and full payments, Nelnet has inaccurately reported my account as delinquent to the credit bureaus, resulting in an unjustified and significant drop in my credit score. 

This action is in direct violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), 15 U.S. Code 1681s-2 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ), which stipulates that a furnisher of credit information must not report inaccurate information to a consumer reporting agency.

03/25/25,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Received bad information about your loan,"Formal Dispute Regarding False Identity Theft Designation and Failure to Investigate CFPB Complaint ID XXXX and XXXX From : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX Account Number XXXX XXXX To : Aidvantage Dispute Resolution Department XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX CC : XXXX, CFPB, FTC Subject : Formal Demand for Investigation and Correction of False Fraud Classification on Student Loan Account To Aidvantage Dispute Resolution Department, This letter serves as a formal dispute and demand for correction regarding your false designation of my student loan account as associated with an identity theft or forgery claim. I did not initiate, authorize, or consent to any identity theft claim or fraud dispute on this account. Your actions have triggered a chain of violations under federal and XXXX consumer protection laws. 
This letter supplements and escalates my previously filed complaints with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau under CFPB Complaint ID XXXX and CFPB Complaint ID XXXX. 
Aidvantages responses dated XX/XX/year>, and XX/XX/year>, both failed to address the core allegations raised in those filings. Instead of conducting a lawful investigation into the unauthorized fraud classification of my account, Aidvantage issued vague, boilerplate responses that ignored my sworn and notarized documentation, misrepresented the source of the alleged fraud designation, and improperly redirected the issue to an unrelated complaint against XXXX. 
These responses collectively reveal a pattern of procedural misconduct and regulatory evasion. 
Breach of Federal Servicing Obligations and Public Trust Standards Aidvantages designation as a federal loan servicer is not a privilege of discretionit is a position of legal obligation. By accepting federal funds, handling federally-backed consumer accounts, and transmitting information to consumer reporting agencies, Aidvantage operates under binding statutory, fiduciary, and commercial standards enforceable by law, irrespective of any federal agency intermediary. 
Aidvantages conduct in this matterfalsely labeling a consumer loan as associated with identity theft, failing to provide investigative records, and misrepresenting the source of the classificationconstitutes a direct breach of the following core obligations : Statutory Compliance : Aidvantage is legally bound to adhere to the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), the Consumer Financial Protection Act ( CFPA ), and all federal consumer protection laws governing data accuracy, investigatory integrity, and truthful consumer communication. These are not optional. Violation of these statutes renders the servicer liable under 15 U.S.C. 1681n and 1681o ( willful/negligent noncompliance ), and 12 U.S.C. 5536 ( UDAAP ). 
Fiduciary Duty to the Borrower : Servicers of federal accounts are entrusted with sensitive financial and identity-related data. Misclassifying an account as fraudulent without consent or evidence violates the fundamental duty of care owed to consumers and erodes the trust that underpins all federally-linked servicing relationships. 
Contract-Based Responsibilities : Regardless of whether specific contractual terms are publicly disclosed, any entity entrusted with the management of federally supported debt must act in accordance with implied covenants of good faith and fair dealing. Assigning a fraud designation without basis, ignoring formal rebuttals, and demanding that the consumer write a letter to fix the servicers own misconduct is a textbook breach of commercial servicer conduct. 
Public Trust Accountability : Aidvantage acts as a federal-facing data gatekeeper. It is accountable not just to the borrower, but to the integrity of the public credit infrastructure and consumer reporting ecosystem. Misuse of this role constitutes a material breach of public trust, with potential implications for systemic risk, regulatory scrutiny, and litigation exposure. 
Aidvantages pattern of evasion, misrepresentation, and procedural noncompliance in this case places the company on a collision course with multi-agency enforcement. The breach is not merely technicalit is institutional. 
I. Summary of Violations and Procedural Failures 1. Misclassification Without Authorization You labeled my student loan as part of an identity theft claim without my consent. No identity theft or fraud claim was submitted by me to Aidvantage or XXXX regarding this account. 
2. Failure to Investigate and Provide Evidence You failed to disclose : Who submitted the alleged fraud report Any communication logs showing attempted outreach Any documentation used to support the identity theft designation 3. Improper Burden-Shifting Both your XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX responses instructed me to write a letter to remove the fraud designationdespite the fact that I never initiated it. This is procedurally and legally improper under FCRA 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( B ), which requires furnishers to correct false information without placing the burden on the consumer. 
4. Misdirection and False Claims to a Federal Agency You repeatedly cited CFPB Complaint ID XXXX ( filed against XXXX ), falsely claiming it triggered your internal fraud process. This is a material misrepresentation to both me and federal regulators. 
5. Failure to Acknowledge Sworn and Notarized Evidence You ignored the Affidavit of Truth and FTC Fraud Report submitted in connection with my disputeboth of which clearly confirm that I never filed an identity theft or fraud-related dispute. Your failure to acknowledge or address these materials violates your duties under the FCRA and CFPA. 
II. Legal and Statutory Violations Federal Law : FCRA 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( B ) : Furnishing inaccurate information without authorization.

Summary of Issue : I submitted IDR and PSLF applications on XX/XX/year>, via StudentAid.gov. 

As of today, my XXXX XXXX confirms PSLF approval, showing XXXX out of XXXX qualifying payments. 

On XX/XX/year>, I spoke with EdFinancial rep XXXX, who confirmed my loans are on temporary hold until XX/XX/year>, due to the IDR application. They were very reluctant to help, refusing to transfer my call to his supervisor and refused to give me his name. When requested he stated no for both, lacking transparency. It wasn't until he could no longer provide relevant information I requested that he granted my transfer to his supervisor. 

He informed me the delinquency would be reversed and my account would be reported as current by XX/XX/year> due to my pending IDR application A supervisor, XXXX, confirmed retroactive payment adjustments and provided a timeline of prior contact attempts many of which I never received. 

I have already filed disputes with XXXX XXXX XXXX and submitted My first complaint to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ). 

This now the issue I am having with EdFinicial : PSLF Concerns : During the call, XXXX pushed me to consolidate my loans, despite the fact that doing so would cause me to lose all XXXX qualifying PSLF payments already recorded. He also insisted that they, EdFinicial, would still be my loan servicers. This was deeply concerning, especially since XXXX is the designated servicer for PSLF, and my loans have not yet been transferred from EdFinancial. 

Violations and Legal Basis : Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), data furnishers like EdFinancial must report accurate and timely information. Reporting me delinquent while in active repayment plan review appears to violate this principle. They are waiting over a week, despite being current as of today. 

Under the Higher Education Act ( HEA ), borrowers in the process of applying for an income-driven plan should not be penalized with negative credit marks or be given misleading servicing advice that jeopardizes PSLF eligibility.",None,EdFinancial Services,IN,47130,None,Consent provided,Web,04/21/25,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,13091217

04/21/25,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Struggling to repay your loan,"Problem with forgiveness, cancellation, or discharge","Subject : Complaint Regarding Outstanding Federal Student Loans from XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX University Dear Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, I hope this letter finds you well. I am writing to formally file a complaint concerning my federal student loans associated with both XXXX XXXX ( XXXX  ) and XXXX XXXX University ( XXXX ), which are still showing outstanding balances despite the recent announcements about loan forgiveness under the borrower defense to repayment regulations. 

In XX/XX/XXXX, the U.S. Department of Education announced it would forgive {$71.00} XXXX in federal student loan debt, holding XXXX liable for {$24.00} XXXX. This decision was based on the recognition of deceptive practices that misled students about the value of their degrees and the quality of education provided. Furthermore, XXXX has faced similar scrutiny due to its recruitment tactics and promises that were not fulfilled, leading many graduates, including myself, to seek relief through the same borrower defense process. 

As a borrower who attended both XXXX and XXXX, I was hopeful that my loans would be included in this forgiveness initiative. However, upon reviewing my loan status, I found that my balances remain unchanged, which has caused substantial financial and emotional distress. This situation is further exacerbated by my repeated attempts to contact my loan servicer, where I have received inadequate responses and no clear guidance on how to address my concerns. Also, I received communications stating the discharge of loans if the lawsuit was successful. So far, I have not received the dismal from the account balance. 

Not only do I find it frustrating to witness the federal government 's acknowledgment of wrongdoing by these institutions, but I am also deeply troubled that my loans do not reflect this action. The lingering balances are a constant reminder of the financial burden I believed would be alleviated. 

Given this context, I respectfully request your assistance in resolving this matter. Borrowers like me must receive timely and accurate information regarding our rights under the borrower defense to repayment regulations. Additionally, I urge the CFPB to take action to ensure that loan services adhere to federal directives and correctly process the discharge of loans for affected students from both XXXX  and XXXX without unnecessary delays. 

Also, I would like to bring to the attention potential violations of laws that XXXX have occurred at XXXX University and XXXX XXXX University ( XXXX ) regarding their marketing practices and the educational services they provide to students, which include : Under the Higher Education Act of 1965 ( HEA ), schools are required to adhere to specific regulations that ensure transparency and fairness in their student recruitment practices. The "" XXXX XXXX to Repayment ( BDR ) '' provision, established under the HEA, protects borrowers from institutions that mislead them about their programs or the value of their degrees. Students who have been misled or those who suffered financial harm as a result are eligible to seek relief under this law. 

Additionally, the specific regulations defined in 34 CFR 685.206 outline the BDR process and the criteria for eligibility. XXXX and XXXX made false representations about their programs, services, and job placement rates, students have valid claims for loan forgiveness based on these regulations. 

Furthermore, the "" Federal Student Aid ( FSA ) Guidelines '' issued by the U.S. Department of Education stipulate that educational institutions must provide clear and accurate information regarding their programs. Any misrepresentations could be grounds for students to pursue claims under the BDR provisions.

Moreover, various "" consumer protection laws '' at both the federal and state levels protect students from deceptive practices. These laws require educational institutions to be forthright in their marketing and communications. If either XXXX or XXXX misrepresented critical aspects of their educational offerings, they were held accountable under these laws. 

I urge the appropriate regulatory bodies to thoroughly investigate these matters to ensure that students who have been affected are granted the relief they deserve. 

Thank you for your attention to this pressing matter. I look forward to your prompt response and any guidance you can provide to help rectify this situation.",None,"Maximus Federal Services, Inc.",GA,30032,None,Consent provided,Web,04/21/25,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,13084023

At no point did I receive any communication from Nelnetvia phone, physical mail, or emailindicating that another loan under my name had become delinquent. 

Instead, Nelnet sent email communications regarding the outstanding balance to my father. Upon receiving XXXX such message, he contacted Nelnet and referenced the account number provided in the email, but was informed that Nelnet had no record of that account number. This further contributed to our confusion and concern. 

On XX/XX/year>, while preparing to purchase a new vehicle for my growing family ( with a baby due in early XXXX ), I checked my credit report and was shocked to find that my credit score had plummeted from XXXX to XXXX since XXXX.

While I acknowledge they received my XXXX  request XXXX their response remains inadequate and does not resolve my complaint for the following reasons : Failure to Respond Correctly to Debt Validation : While Aidvantage has now attached a document to this complaint response, they failed to provide any validation or response directly to my debt validation letter, sent via certified mail on XX/XX/year>, within the timeframe required by law. Improper Collection Activity : Despite receiving my validation request, Aidvantage continued collection activities by sending a bill statement dated XX/XX/year>. This action occurred after they received my validation letter but before providing the legally required validation in response to that letter. This appears to be a violation of the FDCPA, which requires ceasing collection attempts until validation is provided after a timely request. 
Inadequate Validation Document : The document provided with the complaint response was not sent in direct response to my formal validation letter as required. Furthermore, this document alone may not constitute sufficient validation, which typically requires a more detailed accounting of the debt. 
Failure to Address the Core Issue : Aidvantage 's response neglects to address the central issue : their failure to cease collection and provide timely validation in response to my original certified letter, and the potentially unlawful collection activity ( the XX/XX/XXXX bill ) that occurred as a result. Attaching a document later to a regulatory complaint does not retroactively cure the initial failure to comply with the FDCPA upon receiving the direct request. Therefore, their response is unacceptable. I reiterate my request that Aidvantage cease all collection activity until proper and complete validation of the debt is provided correctly according to legal requirements. I also request an investigation into the collection activities following my XX/XX/XXXX letter and the correction of any related negative information on my credit report.",None,"Maximus Federal Services, Inc.",KY,411XX,None,Consent provided,Web,05/08/25,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,13410623

2. Full Disclosure A comprehensive list of entities or individuals involved in accessing, modifying, or deleting my records.

It has come to my attention that Navient has shared, disclosed, or otherwise permitted access to my personal, financial, or sensitive information without my informed consent or authorization.

Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), 15 U.S.C. 1681 et seq. Under this law, consumer information may only be shared for permissible purposes with clear and specific consumer authorization.

This data breach compromises my right to privacy under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act ( FERPA ) and Title IV regulations. 
In XX/XX/year>, multiple reports emerged indicating that XXXX XXXX and associated parties accessed sensitive student loan data without authorization. Legal actions have been initiated by unions and educational organizations to address this egregious violation of privacy. For example : The American Federation of Teachers filed a federal lawsuit alleging an unprecedented and illegal hack of private data. 
The University of California XXXX XXXX filed a lawsuit against the Department of Education for sharing the personal financial data of millions of student loan borrowers with XXXX XXXX and unauthorized entities. 
Lawmakers are actively investigating the Department of Government Efficiency 's access to internal systems containing the personal information of tens of millions of Americans. 
These unauthorized actions raise significant concerns regarding potential identity theft, fraud, and violations of federal data security standards. Due to the severity of this breach and its direct impact on my financial security and privacy, I am demanding the immediate discharge and cancellation of my federal student loans. 
I am also requesting a thorough investigation to determine how my records were accessed and who was responsible for this breach. Immediate measures should be taken to safeguard my information and ensure that similar violations do not occur in the future.

My information was among that dataset that has been compromised. I have been forced into forbearance for the last several months without access and cohesive communication, intentionally misleading information, inaccessible support structure to remedy this. I have chosen a career based on the agreement for pslf and loan structure, and the loan servicer and department of education, federal government are violating agreement and conducting business in a way that is intentionally corrupt, misleading, fraudulent. Moreover, my previous servicer pushed the SAVE program on me, and I signed up for it with their advice and pressure. Investigation and restitution is asked as it regards the dept of education, mohela, nelnet, and aid advantage. Further, my information has been violated and unauthorized access and breach of my educational records, financial aid data, and IRS tax information by the U.S. Department of Education ( DOE ) and the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ). This breach constitutes a direct violation of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act ( FERPA ) and Title IV regulations, as well as an egregious violation of my personal privacy and financial security. 
I recently discovered that my sensitive and legally protected records were accessed and potentially shared without my consent. This includes but is not limited to : 1. My academic records and personally identifiable information ( PII ). 
2. My Free Application for Federal Student Aid ( FAFSA ) data, including financial aid history and loan information. 
XXXX. My IRS tax transcripts, which were obtained and used without proper authorization. 
These actions violate my rights under FERPA ( 20 U.S.C. 1232g ; 34 CFR Part 99 ), which grants me the right to control access to my educational records, as well as Title IV of the Higher Education Act, which governs the use and protection of federal student aid information. Furthermore, unauthorized access to my IRS tax data raises serious concerns regarding potential identity theft, fraud, and violations of federal data security standards. 
Given the severity of this breach and the direct impact on my financial security and privacy, I demand the following corrective actions : 1. Immediate discharge and cancellation of all my federal student loans due to the breach of my financial aid and tax records, which invalidates the integrity of my loan agreements. 
2. A formal investigation into this data breach, including details on how my records were accessed, who accessed them, and for what purpose.

3. A full report on the extent of my data exposure and the corrective measures being implemented to prevent future violations. 
4. Immediate notification to all major credit bureaus ( XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX XXXX ) to place a fraud alert and investigate any unauthorized activity that may have resulted from this breach. 
This breach has caused significant distress and concern regarding the security of my personal and financial data. If my demands are not met within 30 days, I will be left with no choice but to escalate this matter through legal channels, including filing complaints with the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ), the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ), and pursuing legal action against the responsible parties.

05/03/25,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Trouble with how payments are being handled,"The only option that were offered were to either put, my loans into forbearance or deferment. While these were accessible early on as a payment option, interest on each loan continued to accumulate, which placed me in a difficult position when payments resumed. If I lowered my monthly payments, the interest alone would negate any payments made and would continue accumulate and extending the time needed to payoff the total amount owed. If that were to happen it would inevitably increase the total interest per loan over time, snowballing into a greater total sum. 

After XXXX years of making payments on a {$16000.00} loan ( XXXX subsidized & XXXX unsubsidized ) from XX/XX/XXXX to XXXX, I still have a balance of {$15000.00} and I see no way of paying this off by estimated payoff date of XXXX. If I were to increase monthly payments, I would not be able to afford my bills, day to day necessities, food, and transportation to and from work. All available options offered to me would extend the period of time needed to payoff the loans and increase the amounts necessary to pay it off. 

Many student loans borrowers, including myself, do not qualified for Public Service Loan Forgiveness ( PSLF ) or Teacher Loan Forgiveness ( TLF ). We took on these loans at a young age, assuming that by graduation we would have secured jobs that could support both student debt repayment and basic living expenses. However, I feel mislead by loan servicers due to lack of information provided about compounding interest, inflation, and stagnant wages all of which make monthly repayment an unrealistic expectation. 

These financial hardships are not only limited to public servants. Today 's economy is made up of, but not limited to contract works, freelancers, and home aides all of whom contribute significantly to society. While I fully support loan forgiveness for public servants, I also believe that this benefit should be offered to those who do not qualify under ( PSLF or TLF ).

The closure of this campus, and the school as a whole, stemmed from a lawsuit filed by former students. These individuals, like myself, were unable to secure employment after graduating or found that their credits would not transfer to other institutionsleaving them in a position of having paid for an education that ultimately held little to no value. The lawsuit highlighted the misleading and fraudulent practices carried out by the institution, which led to significant student debt with no return on investment.

I firmly believe that being forced to bear the burden of this debt is unjust and financially damaging, especially considering the schools closure was due to verified misconduct and misrepresentation.

On XX/XX/XXXX - the company replied with the following : Thank you for reaching out to the CFPB with your concerns regarding your federal student loan account. We understand you are concerned that your newly consolidated loan has not been enrolled in the SAVE plan. You also stated that when you contacted Aidvantage we were unable to advise why the loan hasnt been enrolled in the plan. However, our records show that when you called Aidvantage on XX/XX/XXXX you were correctly advised that due to a Federal court issued injunction the U.S. Department of Education is prevented from implementing parts of the SAVE Plan and other IDR Plans. As advised on XX/XX/XXXX, we are unable to process the plan due to the court injunction.

It has been over 60 days with interest accruing, and the SAVE application should now be in forbearance since I applied and it was never processed. The government states : As of XX/XX/XXXX, borrowers may apply for the following IDR plans : Pay As You Earn ( PAYE ), SAVE ( previously known as REPAYE ), Income-Based Repayment ( IBR ), and Income-Contingent Repayment ( ICR ), if borrowers meet any plan specific eligibility requirements.. For borrowers who would prefer to make payments during this time -- such as borrowers pursuing PSLF or low-income borrowers who would owe no monthly payments -- enrolling in PAYE or ICR may be an option to consider. Borrowers are still permitted to apply for the SAVE plan ( previously known as REPAYE ), even though the court has enjoined some of the SAVE and other IDR plan provisions, including forgiveness. The Department is working with servicers and contractors to update their systems to align with the terms of the SAVE plan, based on the terms of the injunction. This process will take several months. Ultimately, the terms of the SAVE Plan and other IDR plans are subject to the outcome of ongoing litigation. If servicers need time to process a borrowers IDR application, servicers will move the borrower into a processing forbearance for up to 60 days. Interest accrues during this short-term processing forbearance, and time in the processing forbearance that does provide IDR and PSLF credit. If the borrowers application is not processed by their servicer within 60 days, the borrower will be moved into a general forbearance that does not count toward PSLF or IDR until their application is processed. Interest will not accrue in this general forbearance.

This communication is filed in accordance with Section 611 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), which provides consumers the right to dispute information in their file that is incomplete or inaccurate.

It has come to my attention that an entity identified as DOGE accessed my private data, including but not limited to my name, Social Security number, financial data, and student loan information, through the U.S. Department of Education ( DOE ) without my knowledge or consent. This access appears to have resulted in unauthorized use, sharing, or modification of my student loan information.

Key points of my dispute : 1. I did not authorize DOGE or any affiliated entity to access or utilize my data held by the DOE.

2. No prior notification, consent, or legal disclosure was provided to me regarding this access or data sharing.

3. This potential data breach raises serious concerns regarding compliance with priva

cy regulations, FERPA, and consumer protection statutes. 4. I am requesting a full investigation and immediate correction of any related records that may have resulted
in inaccurate reporting, unauthorized servicing, or erroneous debt assignment.

Requested Actions : Initiate a formal investigation into this unauthorized access and use of my information.

Provide documentation verifying the legal basis upon which DOGE accessed my DOE records.

Remove or correct any inaccuracies or unauthorized activity from my credit file and/or loan servicing record.

Suspend any debt collection or loan-related activity connected to this unauthorized access until the investigation is complete.

1. Failure to Provide Verification of Debt Upon written request, the alleged servicer must provide the original promissory note with all wet-ink endorsements and assignments in compliance with the Uniform Commercial Code ( UCC ) Article 3. Aidvantage has failed to produce such verification and, as such, has no lawful standing to report, collect, or otherwise engage in any enforcement action against me. 

2. Failure to Comply with Cease & Desist Order Pursuant to the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ), Aidvantage has been explicitly instructed in writing to cease all communications regarding this matter. Any further attempt to contact me, report adverse information, or collect on this unverified account constitutes continued willful noncompliance and harassment under federal law and is subject to legal recourse. 

3. Failure to Report Account as Disputed & Unlawful Credit Reporting Under 15 U.S.C. 1666b, Aidvantage was required to report this account as disputed while under review. Instead, you falsely and maliciously reported it as late, causing irreparable harm. Any negative reporting while an account remains in dispute constitutes a willful violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) ( 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2 ( b ) ), opening the door for substantial legal liability. 

4. FERPA Violations and Unauthorized Disclosure of Non-Public Information Under 20 U.S.C. 1232g ( b ), financial records linked to educational loans fall under the protection of FERPA. Any transfer, servicing, or assignment of this alleged account without my explicit consent constitutes a breach of privacy rights under federal law. 

5. Securities Fraud & Unlawful Securitization If this alleged debt has been securitized and transferred through financial instruments without full disclosure and proper accounting under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ( 15 U.S.C. 78a et seq. ), Aidvantage is then complicit in an unlawful scheme to deceptively trade student loan instruments in violation of SEC regulations. 

Demand for Immediate Corrective Action In light of the above statutory violations, fraudulent misrepresentations, and failure to lawfully validate the alleged debt, I hereby demand the following corrective actions be completed within fifteen ( 15 ) calendar days of receipt of this notice : 1.

It has come to my attention that my federally protected personal information was accessed by, shared with, or otherwise disclosed to XXXX XXXX or entities under his control, without my consent or knowledge.

This unauthorized access violates multiple federal laws and protections : The Privacy Act of 1974 ( 5 U.S.C. 552a ) This law prohibits federal agencies from disclosing personal information without written consent, except under specific, lawful exceptions. My student loan informationmaintained by the U.S. Department of Education or its servicersshould have been safeguarded under this law. Any unauthorized sharing of my data constitutes a direct violation.

The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act ( FERPA ) ( 20 U.S.C. 1232g ) FERPA protects the privacy of student education records and prohibits disclosure without student consent, including financial aid and loan data when administered by educational institutions or federal programs. This breach appears to contravene FERPAs strict data handling policies.

The Federal Trade Commission Act ( 15 U.S.C. 4158 ) Under Section 5, the FTC prohibits unfair or deceptive acts or practices, including those involving misuse or unauthorized disclosure of consumer data. The disclosure of my private loan information without permission, especially to a non-governmental individual or company, may be an unfair practice and subject to FTC enforcement.

Department of Education Data Governance and Sharing Regulations Under federal student aid regulations, third-party access to loan data must be strictly controlled and logged. Unless expressly authorized or contractually bound to the Department of Education, no external entityespecially not a private corporate actor such as XXXX XXXXshould

be permitted access to my loan or personal records. This disclosure indicates a failure in oversight or a breach of the Departments regulatory framework.

Given the seriousness of these violations, I am requesting the following actions : A formal investigation into how my information was accessed, who authorized it, and for what purpose.

Immediate remedial action to secure and restrict further access to my personal data.

Written confirmation of how my rights were violated under the laws listed above.

Consideration of full loan cancellation or discharge, as restitution for the breach, loss of trust, and potential harm to my identity and financial wellbeing.

I have also submitted complaints to the Federal Student Aid Feedback Center, the Federal Trade Commission, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. I reserve the right to pursue further legal or civil remedies should this matter not be addressed promptly and appropriately.

05/05/25,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Trouble with how payments are being handled,"I am writing to file a formal complaint regarding the inaccurate and harmful credit reporting associated with my federal student loan account, previously serviced by Nelnet and recently transferred to XXXX. This situation has caused significant and immediate damage to my credit profile, and I believe it reflects a broader systemic issue affecting many borrowers during the transition out of pandemic-related deferment. 

Here is a detailed account of my experience : My student loans originated 12 years ago and have been in deferment for the past XXXX years. 
I have a track record of making on-time payments during periods when the loans were in active repayment. 
Without clear or sufficient warning, my loans exited deferment, and XXXX missed payments were reported all at once indicating a XXXX delinquency despite receiving no XXXX or XXXX notices. 
I was only made aware of the delinquency after it was reported to the credit bureaus, at which point I acted immediately. 
I made a payment of {$500.00} on XX/XX/2025, bringing my account current. My total balance across all XXXX loan accounts is {$3500.00}. 
The very next day, on XX/XX/2025, my account was transferred from Nelnet to XXXX and placed into forbearance, without explanation, adding to the confusion and instability of servicing. 

I want to clearly state that I acknowledge there is some fault on my part. It is the borrowers responsibility to remain informed and current. However, after such a long period of deferment, the sudden reactivation of the loans without any formal XXXX notice was not an effective or fair practice. Instead of official communication, the only warnings I received were unfamiliar phone calls which I, like many others in this era of widespread scam activity, ignored for security reasons. In todays climate, unrecognized calls are not a reasonable substitute for formal written or electronic notices. 

Since the incident occurred, I have taken responsible steps to address it : I wrote to both Nelnet and XXXX requesting a goodwill credit adjustment. 
I filed a complaint with my XXXX Attorney XXXX office. 
I have disputed the late payments with the major credit bureaus. 

This situation is part of a nationwide pattern, where borrowers who acted in good faith during deferment are now facing disproportionate financial harm due to inadequate communication, mismanagement, and sudden servicing transitions. I am fully capable and committed to maintaining on-time payments, and I am asking that this issue be reviewed with consideration for a credit reporting correction or relief, based on the circumstances and my prompt action. 

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I am happy to provide any documentation or communication history needed.

Instead, Trellis has engaged in deceptive practices, resulting in excessive interest charges. It is financially unreasonable and legally indefensible for me to have paid {$6200.00} in interest on a {$2500.00} loana clear indication of mismanagement and predatory servicing. 
XXXX. Judgment Miscalculation ( Case # XXXX ) ( EXHIBIT XXXX ) In XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX sued me in XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and won a judgment for {$10000.00}. 
Instead of adjusting my balance, XXXX added {$10000.00} to my loan balance, effectively charging me twice. 
XXXX. Unjustified Loan Rehabilitation and Consolidation Denials Multiple attempts to rehabilitate, consolidate, and enter repayment plans have been denied, with no valid reason provided. 
XXXX. XX/XX/XXXX Hearing Request Denial In XX/XX/XXXX, I requested a hearing to dispute my loan status. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX sent me a letter stating : "" In reviewing your account as part of the hearing process, XXXX has determined your account no longer meets the qualifications for XXXX. Based on this information, it is unnecessary to continue with the hearing process at this time. '' The balance listed on this notice was {$12000.00}. 
XXXX. Other Loans Fully Paid Off While dealing with these unjust loan issues, I continued to make payments on XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, both of which were paid in full. ( EXHIBIT XXXX ) XXXX XXXX Loan : Paid in full : {$1700.00} XXXX Unsubsidized XXXX Loan : Paid in full : {$2500.00}. 
XXXX. Verbal Offer from Trellis Refused in Writing On XX/XX/XXXX, Trellis verbally stated that they could offer me a discounted single payment of {$2300.00} as payment in full for all XXXX loans. However : Trellis refused to put this offer in writing. 
Trellis refused to provide a full Satisfaction of XXXX for XXXX # XXXX, even if I made the payment. 
This further proves that Trellis is acting in bad faith and failing to provide transparent, fair, and accountable loan servicing. 
Requested Actions & Immediate Resolution Given the proven financial hardship, gross errors, and repeated mismanagement, I formally demand the following : A Paid in Full Acknowledgment for each of the XXXX loans that are open and serviced under both of my Social Security numbers. 
A Satisfaction of XXXX for XXXX # XXXX, removing any record of an outstanding balance. 
A full refund for overpayments due to inconsistencies in interest and principal allocation. 
Immediate correction and removal of any remaining balance due to the overpayment of {$24000.00} on loans that originally totaled {$7700.00}. 
I request a written response within 30 days addressing these concerns and confirming my loans have been fully satisfied and when to expect my refund. 
Failure to correct these issues will result in legal action. 
I do not have any trust that this will have any impact, therefore, I also sent correspondence to the following agencies and government representatives : XXXX, CFPB, XXXX Ombudsman XXXX, XXXX XXXX Attorney General, XXXX XXXX XXXX, Representative for CA XXXX Congressional District, XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, US Department of Education, and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. 
Final Statement I am a single mother who has struggled for decades to resolve these loans. I am now looking at colleges for my son, yet I am faced with the heartbreaking reality that these loansmeant to help people better themselveshave done the complete opposite. Instead of advancing my life, they have caused severe financial hardship and countless hours of begging for help, only to be ignored or denied at every turn. 
Now, after everything I have endured, if I am not able to obtain a Paid in Full acknowledgment on all four defaulted loans along with a full Satisfaction of Judgment for the court proceeding, these loans will prevent my son from obtaining financing to attend college. This is an unacceptable consequence of a system that has failed to provide the fair and reasonable resolution for which I have fought. 
I urge you to correct these long-standing errors and provide me with the documentation necessary to clear my recordnot just for my own well-being, but to ensure that my son is not unfairly punished for the failures of this system.",Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law,Texas Guaranteed,CA,92203,None,Consent provided,Web,04/10/25,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,12919333

On XX/XX/XXXX, Nelnet sent me a letter through their portal stating that my federal loans with 0 % interest were paused as of XX/XX/XXXX, through when the payment pause would end, under COVID-19 relief measures and explicitly said : We will notify you in advance of when these relief measures will end. However, I never received any communication from Nelnet notifying me that repayment was restarting, or when my first bill would be due. 

The first indication I received that my loans had entered repayment came in a letter from their portal dated XX/XX/XXXX, stating I was already 15 days past due. I received another notice from their portal on XX/XX/XXXX with the same message, stating that I was again 15 days past due. Then, on XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter from their portal saying I was 45 days past due. Again, none of these letters came with prior billing statements or warnings about due dates.

04/10/25,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Trouble with how payments are being handled,"On XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX XXXX instructed his staff at the Department of Government Efficiency ( DOGE ) to unlawfully enter the U.S. Department of Education. On XX/XX/XXXX, DOGE agents took control of the Departments internal systems, locking out employees and members of Congress. This lockout was widely covered by major news outlets, including XXXX, XXXX, and other prominent stations. During this unauthorized access, it remains unclear exactly what actions were taken or what specific records or data were accessed, altered, or taken during that time. 

This breach directly impacted my personally identifiable education records, which are maintained by XXXXXXXX XXXX, the U.S. Department of Education, and service providers such as XXXX ( which handles federal student loan servicing ). These records include my academic transcripts, enrollment history, and borrower-related information linked to the federal student loans taken out by my parent XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX on my behalf. 

The unauthorized access and potential misuse of these records constitutes a violation of several laws, including : Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act ( FERPA ), which protects the privacy of student education records. The unauthorized disclosure of my education records and personal information is a direct violation of FERPA. 

The Privacy Act of 1974, which safeguards personal information held by federal agencies. The breach by DOGE agents violates the protections established by this law, as they accessed personal and educational data without authorization. 

The Identity Theft and Assumption Deterrence Act, which criminalizes the unauthorized use of personal information. Given the potential for misuse of my financial and educational records, this may be applicable to the actions taken by DOGE and XXXX XXXX. 

Given that DOGE is not a legitimate government agency, and XXXX XXXX holds no official authority within either XXXXXXXX XXXX or the Department of Education, this action was entirely unauthorized. The breach of my records, as well as the potential misuse of my parents loan information, is a serious violation of privacy and security. 

I demand an immediate and thorough investigation into the actions taken during this security breach, including identifying what specific data was accessed or stolen, and any potential misuse of both my personal information and my parents financial records. I expect a prompt response detailing the actions being taken to rectify this situation and ensure that such a breach does not happen again. Removal loans off both my credit report and my parents credit ( XXXX XXXX ) report from any reference to this loan or associated financial obligations, as there is uncertainty about the authenticity of the information. This should include the deletion of any and all records related to the loan from both parties credit history, to prevent long-term damage to our financial standing. This should also be communicated to the credit bureaus XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX. 

According to the Privacy act Located in our Master Promissory Note ( attachment provided ) 1. Who Can Access the Information : The privacy act outlines that access to your information is authorized for : Federal, state, or local agencies ( but these agencies must have a legitimate purpose as defined under law or regulation ). 

Specific private parties ( like financial institutions, guaranty agencies, and educational institutions ) under controlled circumstances ( e.g., loan servicing, fraud investigation ). 

Consumer reporting agencies for credit-related purposes or loan delinquency tracking. 

XXXX XXXX DOGE ( Department of Government Efficiency ) does not fall into any of these categories. Specifically, there is no legal or formal authorization for DOGE or its personnel to access or handle educational loan records from the Department of Education. DOGE is not listed as an authorized agency or party under the Master Promissory Note 's routine uses. This means that any action by DOGE, including accessing or disclosing loan-related information, would violate the terms set forth in this agreement and would be an unauthorized disclosure. 

2. No Explicit Authorization for DOGE or XXXXXXXX XXXX : The privacy statement does not list DOGE or any organization associated with XXXX XXXX as a permissible third party. The language about disclosures specifies agencies and institutions involved in loan servicing, fraud prevention, and collection efforts, but DOGE is not among them. Additionally, DOGE is not a government agency that could be granted access to federal records like the Department of Educations student loan data. 

3. Legitimate Purposes : The passage details the legitimate purposes for data access and disclosure, such as fraud investigation, verifying eligibility, loan servicing, and collections. DOGE does not have a recognized legal or institutional role within these processes. Unless DOGE had been explicitly granted a role by an appropriate federal authority ( which has not been documented or authorized ), they would have no legal standing to access educational records, including loan records under the Master Promissory Note. 

4. Violation of FERPA and Privacy Act : The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act ( FERPA ) also protects educational records from unauthorized access, and based on the information in your complaint, its clear that DOGEs actions likely violated FERPA as well. FERPA limits access to student records without the student 's written consent, except in specific circumstances ( such as disclosures to specific educational officials or authorized third parties ). XXXX XXXX, acting through DOGE, did not have the necessary authorization under FERPA to access these records. 

5. Absence of Transparency on Data Usage : Since there is no clear or documented disclosure allowing DOGE to access or utilize the educational records, it would be safe to say that DOGEs actions likely constitute a violation of not just the Master Promissory Note 's terms but also of privacy and security regulations set out by the Department of Education and relevant federal laws. 

Conclusion : The privacy act of 1974 you from our Master Promissory Note outlines the specific and authorized uses of personal information related to student loans, none of which includes access by DOGE. Therefore, XXXX XXXX XXXX had no legitimate or legal authority to access the Department of Educations records, and their actions represent a clear violation of the terms of the Master Promissory Note, as well as possibly violating federal laws like FERPA and the Privacy Act.

03/28/25,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Don't agree with the fees charged,"I believe there are multiple errors in calculating my accrued interest by XXXX, my former loan servicer and AidVantage, my current loan servicer. I formally entered the SAVE plan on XX/XX/XXXX. My loan was then transferred from XXXX to AidVantage on XX/XX/XXXX. Even if the ending accrued interest amount was correct leaving XXXX ( which I would like to verified as I believe it is incorrect ), the amount of accrued interest that appeared in AidVantage after the transfer was different ( and higher ) then what was last documented in XXXX. I believe there was an error that occurred in the transfer process, and erroneous interest was added. The amount of accrued interest on my current AidVantage account is different then when it entered ( again, on SAVE plan so there should be no additional interest ). AidVantage is also charging me erroneous interest. I have documentation of the following details : XXXX Account XXXX : Outstanding Accrued Interest to date, based on issued statements/date billed : o XX/XX/XXXX : {$740.00} o XX/XX/XXXX : {$80.00} o XX/XX/XXXX : {$1000.00} ( how did it jump up so much compared to prior statement? ). 
o XX/XX/XXXX : {$1100.00} o XX/XX/XXXX : {$1100.00} o XX/XX/XXXX : {$1100.00} ( last statement available ) Total Interest paid in XXXX to XXXX : {$1700.00} ( based on XXXX form from XXXX ) Payments made to XXXX : o XX/XX/XXXX : {$570.00} ( don't have documentation of when received ) o XX/XX/XXXX : {$620.00} ( received XX/XX/XXXX ) o XX/XX/XXXX : {$1200.00} ( received XX/XX/XXXX ) Total of {$2400.00} ( all made in XXXX ) Aid Vantage Account Information XX/XX/XXXX loan Transferred to AidVantage o No Interest Accruing on account since XX/XX/XXXX when established o Entering principal Balance of {$110000.00} plus {$1300.00} unpaid interest = {$110000.00} total is what is documented.. 
Current accrued interest is {$1800.00} and total balance is {$110000.00} Total Interest paid in XXXX to AidVantage based on 1099-E : {$87.00} ( how is this possible if I didn't make a payment in XXXX? ). 

Summary : -last documented accrued interest at XXXX was {$1100.00} ( I dont believe this is accurate ) -documented accrued interest at AidVantage when the transfer was finalized : {$1300.00} ( why is there a difference in the transfer when Im on SAVE plan? ) -Current accrued interest on AidVantage {$1800.00} ( why has it gone up when Im on the SAVE plan? ) I have documentation of all of the above information.",None,"Maximus Federal Services, Inc.",OR,97219,None,Consent provided,Web,03/28/25,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,12694624

I have a total of XXXX loans. XXXX were correctly set to an interest rate of 0 % but XXXX of them were not. Loan XXXX has been continuing to charge interest at a rate of 5.300 % and Loan XXXX has been continuing to charge interest at a rate of 6.280 %. As of today, they have improperly collected a total of {$3900.00} of interest. This interest charge violates the program 's terms, which were implemented to protect borrowers from unnecessary debt accumulation. 

Shortly after discovering the interest charge, I contacted MOHELA. A representative assured me that the interest would be removed. However, the charge remains on my account. Additionally, when I spoke with a supervisor on XX/XX/XXXX, they could not explain the origin of the interest charge and promised that it would be corrected, which never occurred. 

In response to the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX siding in favor of a lawsuit challenging the SAVE program, Education Secretary XXXX XXXX stated on XX/XX/XXXX, that borrowers enrolled in the SAVXXXX plan will be placed in an interest-free forbearance.

I started college in XXXX at XXXX XXXX XXXX and quickly felt taken advantage of by my student loans. After graduating from XXXX, I struggled financially and called to find a way to repay my loans.

XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, AZ XXXX SSN : XXXX XXXX : XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX To : Sallie Mae XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, DE XXXX RE : Dispute of Unverified Student Loan Accounts Immediate Deletion Requested To Whom It May Concern, This letter is a formal dispute submitted in accordance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), 15 U.S.C. 1681 et seq., concerning the reporting of student loan accounts associated with [ Insert Loan Servicer Name or Account Number ( s ), e.g., XXXX on my credit file. 

XXXX. ISSUE : Lack of Verification of a Signed Master Promissory Note ( MPN ) Relevant Law : Under 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ), a credit reporting agency must conduct a reasonable reinvestigation if a consumer disputes the completeness or accuracy of any item in their file. Additionally, under 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ), the CRA must ensure maximum possible accuracy of the information it includes. 
Demand : I am demanding immediate deletion of the referenced student loan account ( s ) from my Experian credit file unless the data furnisher can provide the original, wet-ink signed Master Promissory Note ( MPN ) establishing a valid, enforceable obligation in my name. Electronic reproduction or summary data is not sufficient under federal evidentiary standards, particularly when the debt is disputed. The burden of proof lies with the furnisher. If the original contract does not exist, the tradeline must be removed. 

XXXX. ISSUE : Failure to Verify Current Status Forbearance or Administrative Hold Relevant Law : Per 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2 ( b ), the information furnisher is obligated to investigate disputed information and correct or delete any data found to be inaccurate or unverifiable. If a loan is in administrative forbearance, deferment, or a non-repayment status due to federal policy or executive order, such status must be clearly and accurately reflected in the reporting. Failure to do so constitutes willful misreporting and inaccurate furnishing of information.

Demand : Please verify whether this account is presently subject to administrative forbearance or any federal hold. If it is, it can not legally be reported as delinquent or in default. If this can not be fully verified and proven by the data furnisher, the account must be removed immediately for failure to meet accuracy and verification standards outlined by the FCRA. 

XXXX. ISSUE : XXXX XXXX and CDIA Compliance Failure Relevant Law : The Consumer Data Industry Association ( CDIA ) XXXX XXXX  Format Guidelines, which Experian has adopted for credit furnishing, require that all tradelines be accurate, complete, and up-to-date. Reporting disputed, unverifiable, or administratively frozen debts violates these guidelines. 
Demand : You are required to remove any entry that does not conform with XXXX XXXX and XXXX standards. Student loans that are not contractually verified or are impacted by legislative changes ( such as federal repayment pauses or executive actions ) must not be reported as adverse. If you can not validate this account according to those standards, it must be removed. 
Failure to Comply Will Result in Further Action This is a legal dispute under the FCRA. Should you fail to respond within 30 days with sufficient documentation, I will escalate the matter with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) and consider further legal action under 15 U.S.C. 1681n and 1681o for willful or negligent noncompliance.

The lack of continuity, transparency, and accountability is completely unacceptable and deeply distressing. 

To make matters worse, Aidvantage has placed my loans into forbearance while they attempt to resolve their internal error, further disadvantaging me as a responsible borrower. This forbearance negatively impacts my progress toward Public Service Loan Forgiveness ( PSLF ), by potentially disqualifying these months from my qualifying payment count.

04/22/25,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Incorrect information on your report,Account status incorrect,"I am filing this complaint against Nelnet due to severe and unjustified negative credit reporting that has significantly impacted my financial standing. My credit report was recently updated to reflect over 2 late payment entries from Dept Of Education which has caused my credit score to drop by over XXXX points. This action was taken without any prior notice, warning, or correspondenceI did not receive any emails, letters, or alerts informing me of this drastic change before it was reported to the credit bureaus. 

Additionally, I have become aware of an ongoing data breach involving student loan accounts, which raises serious concerns regarding unauthorized access to my personal and financial information raising concerns over a FERPA violation. Given this security lapse, I have reason to believe that my account records may have been compromised or altered without my consent. 

I am in the process of purchasing a home and this has caused my loan to be halted until this is remedied. This has caused extreme financial distress and this error in reporting needs to be remedied immediately. I did not authorize any changes to my account status, and I no longer feel comfortable having my student loans serviced and reported to the credit bureaus under these conditions. 

Violations and Consumer Protection Rights 1. Failure to Provide Notice of Negative Credit Reporting - Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), loan servicers are required to provide accurate and fair reporting. I was not notified in advance that these accounts would be marked late, which denied me the opportunity to address any potential issues before they were reported.

2. Possible Unauthorized Reporting and Account Compromise Due to Data Breach - The reported data breach involving Nelnet raises serious questions about the integrity of my loan accounts. If my data was exposed or manipulated, Nelnet may have incorrectly or fraudulently reported late payments that I did not actually incur.

3. Failure to Properly Investigate and Verify Account Status - Given the security risks and errors in reporting, I request full verification and documentation proving the legitimacy of the late payments, including a detailed account history showing how and when they were marked late.

Requested Resolution - Immediate removal of all reported late payments from my credit report, as they were reported without proper notice and under potentially compromised circumstances.

- A formal investigation into Department of Education reporting practices to determine whether my data was mishandled or compromised.

- A written response from Department of Education confirming the deletion of these late payments from my credit file. This situation has caused me extreme distress, financial harm, and damage to my creditworthiness.

- I expect a prompt and thorough resolution in compliance with federal consumer protection laws.

XX/XX/year> : I supposedly was sent a summary document via mail recapping the information from my application- per aidvantage customer service rep.

Key Issues : Lack of Disclosure : After submitting the application, I was informed that the consolidation was on hold due to a court injunction.

However, in XX/XX/XXXX, a new XXXX XXXX XXXX was created for {$23000.00}, without any formal or transparent communication with me. This debt includes significant interest and penalties I was not informed about over the years, despite believing my loans were handled through the prior consolidation. 

To make matters worse, my loan records reflect conflicting statuses : Paid in Full through Consolidation appears multiple times for the same loans. 

A loan dated XXXX lists a disbursement of {$23000.00}, even though I have not attended school or requested a loan since the XXXX. 

I never knowingly agreed to this new consolidation, and if I did sign anything, it was under misleading or unclear circumstancespossibly connected to past bankruptcies, forbearance confusion, or default status chaos.

The response provided did not adequately resolve or address my core concerns, which involved serious violations of my privacy, unauthorized changes to my account, and resulting harm to my credit. 


Summary of Appeal Grounds : XXXX. Unauthorized Email Change via Vendor Search Your records indicate that my email address was changed on XX/XX/XXXX, following a vendor search prompted by alleged email bounce backs. I did not authorize this change, nor was I notified prior to or after the update. This constitutes a clear violation of my privacy and established consumer protection laws. The use of third-party vendors to alter personally identifiable information ( PII ) must be consent-based and verifiable. 
Under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act ( GLBA ) Privacy Rule, nonpublic personal information XXXX not be shared with or modified by nonaffiliated third parties without express notice and the opportunity to opt out. Additionally, the Federal Student Aid Master Promissory Note ( MPN ) does not XXXX blanket authorization for vendors to conduct independent information searches or to modify borrower data without the borrowers direct involvement. 
XXXX. Inability to XXXX XXXX Account The unauthorized change to my email address prevented me from logging in or resetting my password, effectively locking me out of my account. As a result, I missed important billing notices and communications. This lack of access stemmed directly from the changes your system initiated without my knowledge or approval. 


3. Negative Credit Reporting and Harm Due to the breakdown in communication and account access, I was unaware that my account had entered a past-due status following the expiration of the on-ramp period. I discovered this delinquency in XX/XX/XXXX when I received a credit monitoring alert showing a drop of approximately XXXX points in my credit score. This damage was caused by circumstances entirely outside of my control, originating with unauthorized changes to my account initiated by your vendor. 
4. Violation of My Promissory Note, GLBA, and the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) The unapproved use of third-party data to modify my account without consent is not only inconsistent with the terms of my promissory note, but it may also violate the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). Furnishing inaccurate or unverifiable information to credit reporting agencies, especially information stemming from system errors or unauthorized account changescould be deemed noncompliant under federal law. Additionally, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ) prohibits deceptive or unfair practices during collection, including wrongful handling of borrower information. 

Relief Requested : Immediate removal or correction of all negative credit reporting related to this incident. 
A full investigation and explanation of the vendor process used to change my email address without my knowledge or approval. 
A written statement confirming all corrective actions taken to secure my account and prevent further unauthorized modifications. 
Copies of all documentation and internal records relating to the vendor search, email update process, and associated decision-making. 

Please consider this my official appeal and request for reconsideration, as outlined in your letter. I respectfully request that this matter be reviewed by a different associate or escalated team via your internal protocol. I expect a written response within the 30-calendar-day timeline required for formal disputes and appeals.

This delinquency appears on my XX/XX/XXXX credit report. I submitted a formal dispute to EdFinancial on XX/XX/XXXX, and followed up on XX/XX/XXXX, but I have not received any acknowledgment or resolution. 

The delinquency is inaccurate for the following reasons : The reported missed payments occurred during the Department of Educations On-Ramp Protection period ( XX/XX/XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  ), which clearly stated that missed payments during this time would not be reported to credit bureaus. 
I received no prior notice of delinquency until XX/XX/XXXX, XXXXafter the 90-day late mark had already been reported. 
The past due amount reported is only {$86.00}, while my monthly payment is {$21.00}. This amount does not equal or exceed three full missed payments and does not support a 90-day delinquency status.

In my original dispute, I requested the following : 1. Immediate removal of the 90-day delinquency from all credit bureaus ( XXXX, XXXX, XXXX ) .

2. Written confirmation that my account is not being treated as in default.

3. Cessation of any adverse actions such as collections, wage garnishment, or loan acceleration while the dispute is under review.

04/19/25,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Struggling to repay your loan,Can't temporarily delay making payments,"I am filing this complaint against Nelnet due to severe and unjustified negative credit reporting that has significantly impacted my financial standing. My credit report was recently updated to reflect late payment entries from Nelnet student loan, which has caused my credit score to drop by over XXXX points. This action was taken without any prior notice, warning, or correspondenceI did not receive any emails, letters, or alerts informing me of this drastic change before it was reported to the credit bureaus. 

Additionally, I have become aware of an ongoing data breach involving student loan accounts, which raises serious concerns regarding unauthorized access to my personal and financial information raising concerns over a FERPA violation. Given this security lapse, I have reason to believe that my account records may have been compromised or altered without my consent. 

I am in the process of purchasing a home and this has caused my loan to be halted until this is remedied. This has caused extreme financial distress and this error in reporting needs to be remedied immediately. I did not authorize any changes to my account status, and I no longer feel comfortable having my student loans serviced and reported to the credit bureaus under these conditions. 

Violations and Consumer Protection Rights 1. Failure to Provide Notice of Negative Credit Reporting - Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), loan servicers are required to provide accurate and fair reporting. I was not notified in advance that these accounts would be marked late, which denied me the opportunity to address any potential issues before they were reported.

2. Possible Unauthorized Reporting and Account Compromise Due to Data Breach - The reported data breach involving Nelnet raises serious questions about the integrity of my loan accounts. If my data was exposed or manipulated, Nelnet may have
incorrectly or fraudulently reported late payments that I did not actually incur.

3. Failure to Properly Investigate and Verify Account Status - Given the security risks and errors in reporting, I request full verification and documentation proving the legitimacy of the late payments, including a detailed account history showing how and when they were marked late.",None,"Nelnet, Inc.",TX,75056,None,Consent provided,Web,04/19/25,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,13073872

This breach occurred via the Department of Government Efficiency ( XXXX ) prior to its official access being revoked in XX/XX/XXXX and constitutes multiple violations of federal law, a total collapse of custodial integrity, and gross negligence on the part of those entrusted to secure my most sensitive personal and financial information. 

Violations and Legal Grounds 1. Violation of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act ( FERPA ) 20 U.S.C. 1232g My education and loan records were accessed without proper consent by an unauthorized agency. This directly violates FERPAs protection of personally identifiable information ( PII ). The Department of Education failed in its duty to prevent and respond to this violation.

2. Privacy Act of 1974 5 U.S.C. 552a This breach also constitutes a direct violation of the Privacy Act, which mandates that personal records maintained by federal agencies be protected from unauthorized access and dissemination. I demand to invoke my rights under this law to contest and amend any records accessed or altered through this unlawful breach.

3. Federal Rules of Evidence Rule 901 ( Chain of Custody & Document Authentication ) This breach calls into question the legitimacy, source, and accuracy of all documents, contracts, and data associated with my federal loans. Due to the broken chain of custody and compromised data security, I am formally challenging the enforceability of these debts.

4. Federal Trade Commission Act 15 U.S.C. 4158 ( Unfair and Deceptive Practices ) This incident represents clear federal negligence in protecting consumer data. The U.S. Department of Education and its affiliates have engaged in unfair and deceptive practices by failing to properly secure my private information, putting me at significant and ongoing risk of identity theft and financial harm. 

Actions Ive Been Forced to Take to Protect Myself Due to your failures, I have had to independently take these emergency measures : Changed credentials on all major personal and financial platforms ( including StudentAid.gov ) ; Enabled multi-factor authentication across accounts ; Filed fraud alerts with Experian, Equifax, and TransUnion ; Subscribed to identity theft monitoring and credit protection services ; Reviewed and documented all financial activity for suspicious behavior. 

These are not preventativethey are reactive countermeasures forced upon me because your systems failed. 

Formal Demands for Immediate Relief 1. Full cancellation and discharge of all federal student loans under Account No. 9459158461, based on the irreparable breach of custodial integrity, FERPA violations, and Privacy Act infractions.

2. Immediate freeze and suspension of all collections, interest accrual, credit reporting, or enforcement actions related to this account until a full legal audit is completed. 
XXXX. Comprehensive forensic report detailing : All unauthorized access events, Dates and nature of breach, Individuals and agencies involved, The legal basis ( or lack thereof ) for such access.

As a borrower of federal student loans, I entered into a contractual agreement with the Department of Education. My promissory note explicitly states that my obligations are to the DOE, and I did not consent to any transfer of my loan management to the SBA or any other entity. The reported move of student loan oversight from the DOE to the SBA under the upcoming administration raises serious legal and ethical questions regarding the sanctity of this agreement and my rights as a borrower.

Furthermore, I am deeply concerned about the improper handling of my personal and financial information. If this transfer occurs, it may constitute a breach of my right to privacy and a violation of FERPA, which protects the confidentiality of student records. I am also alarmed by the potential unauthorized access to my loan data by third-party entities, including individuals or corporations with no legal right to this information.

Given the gravity of these concerns, I respectfully request that your office : Investigate whether the proposed transfer of student loans from the DOE to the SBA in 2025 constitutes a breach of contract and a violation of borrower rights.

Examine whether this transfer or any related actions violate FERPA by exposing students ' personal and financial data to unauthorized entities.

Determine whether third-party entities, including private individuals or corporations, have accessed or mishandled borrower information in a manner that infringes upon privacy laws.

Take legal action, if necessary, to protect borrowers from any unlawful or unconstitutional policies that may arise from this transition.

I urge your office to take swift action to prevent potential harm to millions of student loan borrowers who may be impacted by this unprecedented shift in student loan administration. Please provide guidance on what legal protections are available to borrowers in my situation and any steps I can take to safeguard my rights.

Thank you for your time and attention to this urgent matter. I look forward to your response.

My name is XXXX XXXX XXXX, and Im writing to demand accountability and answers. I am a XXXX XXXX  XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX I borrowed less than {$7000.00} in student loans between XXXX, which were consolidated and marked paid in full by XXXX. I have not returned to school or taken out any new student loans since. 

Yet in XX/XX/XXXX, a new XXXX XXXX XXXX for {$23000.00} appeared on my account. It was labeled as a disbursement, but I never requested or authorized it. I never gave informed consent. I was not told this loan was being created. I didnt apply for anything. This was done behind my backor buried in a sea of confusing paperwork. If I did sign something, it was under false pretenses during a time when I was already overwhelmed by financial hardship, bankruptcy, and mental health trauma. 

Before XXXX took over this loan, it was handled by Navient, a servicer that has already been exposed for illegal and deceptive practices. I believe Navient initiated or influenced this fraudulent consolidation as part of a so-called clean-up after years of mismanagementlikely without clear disclosure to me, and without any option to opt out. 

My student aid file is filled with conflicting information : Loans are listed multiple times as Paid in Full Through Consolidationyet the debt never goes away. 

The XXXX loan falsely shows a disbursement, as if I was a student again. I was not. 

Interest and fees have piled on for years through capitalized interest, forbearance cycles, and default statuses I was never fully informed about. 

What began as a manageable debt from my XXXX has grown into a {$24000.00} financial burden that I should not owe. 

This feels like systemic abuse. This feels like gaslighting. I am a real person who has tried to do the right thingonly to be caught in an endless, confusing, and soul-crushing loop of lies, consolidations, and rebranded debt. 

I am demanding : A full investigation into how the XXXX consolidation loan was created. 

Proof of any consent I gave. 

Confirmation that my original loans were resolved in XXXX.

My college career started in XXXX and was ended abruptly in XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX.

As you are well aware, the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX was one of the hardest-hit sectors during the COVID-19 pandemiXXXX, beginning in early XXXX same year I XXXX  The global shutdown of travel, hotel operations, events, and restaurants lasted well beyond initial projections, extending over four years in many areas. During this critical time, job opportunities became virtually non-existent, and many businesses in the industry permanently closed their doors. 

In addition to the lengthy disruption, the entire landscape of the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX has changed dramatically. The education I received is now outdated, with many of the skills and practices I was taught no longer relevant or applicable in the post-pandemic world. Employers now demand different qualifications and competencies that were not part of my original curriculum. Furthermore, the competition in the job market has intensified, with displaced experienced professionals re-entering the workforce and securing roles that would have otherwise been available to recent graduates like myself. 

I believe it is both unreasonable and unjust to expect repayment for a degree that has notand likely will notprovide the return on investment it was intended to deliver due to circumstances completely beyond my control. Like many others in my graduating class and industry, I am left with significant debt and little to no opportunity to use the education I paid for. 

Therefore, I am respectfully requesting a review of my student loan status and consideration for full or partial loan forgiveness under existing or new hardship, economic disruption, or borrower defense provisions. I am more than willing to provide documentation, including my graduation records, employment history, and proof of industry decline, to support this request.

My credit report was recently updated to reflect over 20 late payment entries from DEPT OF EDUCATION/XXXX , which has caused my credit score to drop by over XXXX points. This action was taken without any prior notice, warning, or correspondenceI did not receive any emails, letters, or alerts informing me of this drastic change before it was reported to the credit bureaus. Additionally, I have become aware of an ongoing data breach involving student loan accounts, which raises serious concerns regarding unauthorized access to my personal and financial information raising concerns over a FERPA violation. Given this security lapse, I have reason to believe that my account records may have been compromised or altered without my consent. I am in the process of purchasing a home and this has caused my loan to be halted until this is
remedied. This has caused extreme financial distress and this error in reporting needs to be remedied immediately. I did not authorize any changes to my account status, and I no longer feel comfortable having my student loans serviced and reported to the credit bureaus under these conditions.

Violations and Consumer Protection Rights 1. Failure to Provide Notice of Negative Credit Reporting - Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), loan servicers are required to provide accurate and fair reporting. I was not notified in advance that these accounts would be marked late, which denied me the opportunity to address any potential issues before they were reported.

2. Possible Unauthorized Reporting and Account Compromise Due to Data Breach - The reported data breach involving XXXX  raises serious questions about the integrity of my loan accounts. If my data was exposed or manipulated, XXXX  may have incorrectly or fraudulently reported late payments that I did not actually incur.

3. Failure to Properly Investigate and Verify Account Status - Given the security risks and errors in reporting, I request full verification and documentation proving the legitimacy of the late payments, including a detailed account history showing how and when they were marked late.

Requested Resolution - Immediate removal of all reported late payments from my credit report, as they were reported without proper notice and under potentially compromised circumstances.

- A formal investigation into ENTER YOUR STUDENT LOAN COMPANIES NAME HERE reporting practices to determine whether my data was mishandled or compromised. - A written response from ENTER YOUR STUDENT LOAN COMPANIES NAME HERE confirming the deletion of these late payments from my credit file.

Truth in Lending Act ( 15 U.S.C. 1601 et seq. ) : \nAny entity involved in extending credit or collecting payments must provide clear, timely, and transparent information about terms, interest rates, and repayment options. I dispute whether such disclosures were provided or understood at the time of origination. 
Fair Credit Reporting Act ( 15 U.S.C. 1681 ) : \nIf this loan is being reported to credit bureaus, you are required to ensure that all information is accurate, verifiable, and complete. Inaccurate reporting constitutes a violation of my rights and may result in legal penalties. 
Administrative Procedure Act ( 5 U.S.C. 551559 ) : \nAny major change in agency structure, authority, or regulation ( such as dismantling the Department of Education or transferring loan oversight ) must be governed by due process and public rulemaking. Until such clarity is established, enforcement of loan obligations may be legally premature. 
Borrower Defense to Repayment ( 34 CFR 685.206 ) : \nIf the school or lender engaged in deceptive or unlawful practices, I reserve the right to pursue a full discharge under this program. I request a review of whether my educational institution is under investigation or has been involved in any such misconduct. 
Request for Action Provide full validation and accounting of the loan ( s ), including : Original loan agreements and disbursement records Payment history Interest and fee breakdown Place the loan in forbearance or administrative hold during the investigation Cease any collection or wage garnishment efforts Refrain from reporting negative information to credit bureaus Clarify any upcoming changes in loan servicing authority related to agency restructuring If this matter is not resolved within 30 days, I reserve the right to escalate my concerns to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ), State Attorney General, and/or pursue remedies through legal channels.

04/07/25,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Problem with customer service,"I am writing to formally file a complaint concerning the servicing of my Federal Perkins Loan ( or NDSL/Defense Loan ) by HeartlandXXXX in connection with actions taken by the University of Texas at XXXX XXXX XXXX office . 

I was recently informed via a letter from the University XXXX XXXX at XXXX that my Federal Perkins Loan has been transferred to the U.S. Department of Education for collection. This transfer was due to an alleged default on my loan that occurred over 24 months ago. However, I would like to clarify several key issues regarding this situation that I believe constitute violations of my borrower rights. 

XXXX. ) Lack of Communication : I have never received any prior correspondence from HeartlandXXXX XXXXr was I informed of any default status on my loan. I was unaware that Heartland/XXXX XXXXas the servicer of my loan, and I received no notices about any late payments or issues with my loan. This lack of communication is particularly concerning given that I was unaware of any default status until the recent transfer notice. 

XXXX. ) Inaccurate Reporting and Default Status : My loans have been in forbearance, and they were in forbearance at the time of the alleged default. I have made diligent efforts to maintain the terms of my loan and was under the impression that my loans were properly serviced and managed during this forbearance period. The negative/adverse credit reporting associated with this situation is misleading, and I strongly contest the accuracy of the reported default. 

XXXX. ) Failure to Resolve the Issue with HeartlandXXXX : I made several attempts to resolve this issue directly with Heartland/XXXX  However, despite my efforts, the servicer failed to provide meaningful assistance or clarification regarding the status of my loan. This lack of support and communication has led to unnecessary confusion and hardship. 

XXXX. ) Violation of Borrower Rights : I believe that my rights as a borrower have been violated due to the failure of HeartlandXXXX to communicate with me adequately regarding my loan, the apparent mishandling of the forbearance status, and the adverse reporting of my credit. 

Given these issues, I respectfully request that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau investigate this matter and assist in rectifying the negative impact caused by the incorrect default status and the lack of communication from HeartlandXXXX. I seek the removal of any incorrect default information from my credit report and the proper resolution of my loan status in line with the protections provided to borrowers under federal law.",None,HEARTLAND PAYMENT SYSTEMS INC,TX,75040,None,Consent provided,Web,04/07/25,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,12851495

04/17/25,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Received bad information about your loan,"Unfortunately, I have found that I was taken advantage of by a textbook example of forbearance steering, as defined by the CFPBs 2022 enforcement actions against XXXX and supported by federal regulation ( 34 CFR 682.211 ( f ), 685.205 ( b ) ). 

Between XXXX and XXXX, I contacted XXXX repeatedly due to financial hardship. Rather than informing me of my eligibility for income-driven repayment ( IDR ) plans or the federal loan rehabilitation program ( per servicer obligations under Title IV of the Higher Education Act ), I was steered into a series of long-term forbearances. Customer service representatives pressed that I qualified for "" XXXX dollar payments '' and that there were no consequences, and no other options were provided to me. 

When the forbearance expired around XXXX, I was contacted and told that unless I could afford an exorbitant paymentunaffordable at the timemy only option was consolidation. I was NOT told about IDR or rehabilitation, both of which I later discovered would have preserved my balance, avoided interest capitalization, and maintained progress toward loan forgiveness. 

As a result of this coercive consolidation by XXXX, my balance ballooned from ~ {$48000.00} to over {$85000.00}. It capitalized interest and reset my forgiveness clock. Since then, I have made over 151 qualifying IDR payments. 

Critically, the data shows that I was placed in repeated forbearances at XXXX 's recommendation during my financial hardship. I was not informed that these forbearances would expire or that they could lead to default. When my forbearance period expired, I was contacted by XXXX and told that my only option was to either consolidate or make unaffordable payments in excess of {$500.00} per month. This created a false urgency and removed any meaningful choice-no income-driven repayment ( IDR ) or rehabilitation plans were offered. This tactic aligns with the forbearance steering practices that were cited in the CFPB 's 2022 enforcement actions against student loan servicers. It was at that point, under financial duress and without being informed of legal alternatives, that I was coerced into consolidating, causing irreversible financial harm. 
This case represents a textbook instance of forbearance steering, as defined by the CFPB 's 2022 enforcement actions against XXXX and supported by federal regulation ( 34 CFR 682.211 ( f ), 685.205 ( b ) ). During the period from XXXX  to XXXX, XXXX failed to inform me of available income-driven repayment ( IDR ) plans or the federally mandated 9-month rehabilitation program, both of which were legal options under Title IV of the Higher Education Act. Instead, I was repeatedly placed into forbearance until its expiration, at which point I was pressured into consolidating under the threat of unaffordable monthly payments exceeding {$500.00}. This practice violated servicer obligations and has since been identified by the Department of Education and the CFPB as a systemic failure. My experience directly aligns with the borrower harms being remedied under the IDR Account Adjustment initiative ( XXXX ), which was implemented to address improper servicing, including coerced consolidations and loss of forgiveness progress. 
Through modeling and consultation with financial experts, I now understand that if I had entered a rehabilitation plan instead of consolidating, my balance today could be nearly half of what it is now. 
Rehabilitation would have preserved my original loans, minimized interest capitalization, and maintained forgiveness eligibility. I have attached a visual comparison of my current repayment path versus the alternative I was never informed of.

Additionally, I made a good-faith attempt to obtain documentation regarding my original disbursements, at the suggestion of my current servicer, Aidvantage. I was advised that with those documents, a balance review could potentially occur. I contacted the XXXX  XXXX XXXX  Financial Aid Office, but was informed that records were no longer available due to the time elapsed since graduation. Likewise, my prior servicer, XXXX, no longer retains access to these historical records. 
This systemic failure to retain critical borrower documentation, compounded by coercive servicing practices, has caused enduring financial harm. I believe this case exemplifies the very forbearance and consolidation steering practices cited in prior CFPB and state attorney general actions against XXXX.",None,"Maximus Federal Services, Inc.",CA,954XX,None,Consent provided,Web,04/17/25,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,13044258

Recently, credible reports have surfaced confirming that the Department of Education and associated third parties, including organizations tied to XXXX XXXX, engaged in breaches involving unauthorized access to and sharing of borrower data.

04/29/25,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Don't agree with the fees charged,"On XX/XX/XXXX, I received an email saying my credit score dropped. When I opened my banking app, I saw that my credit dropped XXXX points overnight. I saw that the Department of Education was named on the loans, so I called the Dept. of Ed. on the XXXX. I talked to XXXX, asking about the loans, as I was unaware of any more student loans linked to my account because I did not see any loans on my Firstmark Services account where I had been paying off {$30000.00} in student loans. I made my last payment in XXXX of XXXX to pay off the {$30000.00} debt. XXXX told me it could be fraud and suggested I ask for forbearance until I could get the loans disputed. On XX/XX/XXXX, I called Firstmark Services to see if I could get any information about the other student loans that seemed to be causing the drop in my credit score. I saw no additional or unpaid loans on my Firstmark account. XXXX at Firstmark Services said that the loans causing the issue may be linked to the federal student loan servicer Nelnet. I then called Nelnet to ask about the loans and to verify if they were legitimately my student loans or if this was a case of fraud. XXXX from Nelnet told me the loans were linked to XXXX XXXX and XXXX University, both institutions I attended. She verified the dates the loans were taken out, which match the dates of my attendance. She told me I owe {$33000.00} total according to the Nelnet account. She said {$2800.00} of interest has accrued at this point. I also have late fees attributed to this account, which is why my credit dropped. She said the payments were due on XX/XX/XXXX. I asked her why I had never received a notification from them. She said they had sent an email, but upon further investigation, we found that the email was incorrect. I asked her why she never sent me a piece of physical mail or called my phone number to inform me about the loans, and she said she could only send an email despite having my home address and phone number. She then told me there was nothing they could do to help me, so I filed a dispute with Nelnet on XX/XX/XXXX. After filing an initial complaint through the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, I received a generic response from Nelnet on XX/XX/XXXX claiming they had reached out to me via phone and email prior to my payments becoming late. However, the response did not clarify where these emails were sent, or which phone number was called. I request that Nelnet provide proof of these communications, as I had never received any phone calls, emails, or letters from Nelnet until I shockingly discovered my credit score had dropped dramatically last month for what seemed to be no reason. Nelnet had not notified me of the late fees, and I do not know when they would have ever notified me if I had not investigated my credit score issue. By the time I uncovered the cause of my credit score drop, late fees and interest had already accumulated on my loans. Let me be clear : I received no communication from Nelnet until after I filed my complaint in XX/XX/XXXX, and as a result, I had no way of making timely payments on these loans. For context, I can provide proof of my history with Firstmark Services, where I consistently paid my loans on time and early. I can also provide evidence that I have always paid my car payments in full and on time I submit these facts as supporting evidence that I had no access to my student loans held with Nelnet, and if I had, they would have been paid on time. Additionally, since Firstmark is a division of Nelnet, I would also like an explanation as to why Nelnet did not send communications to the active email address associated with my Firstmark Services loans, which were being properly paid. If Nelnet had access to my Firstmark loan information and contact details, it is negligent that they did not use this information to ensure I was contacted through methods I would have received. I am employed and have no intention of avoiding my student loan responsibilities. However, Nelnets failure to provide me with access to my account has led to the accumulation of late fees and interest, significantly impacting my credit score. If I had been able to access my loans, I would have made timely payments, accrued less interest, and avoided these late fees. Nelnet did not respond to my complaint with adequate information and again was negligent in providing me with the information needed to access and pay off my student loans. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a new response from Nelnet. Unfortunately, this response failed to address any of the concerns I previously raised. I would like to outline the shortcomings of the response in addressing my claim below : "" XXXX authorized the transfer of your federal student loans from Great Lakes XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) to Nelnet, on XX/XX/XXXX. We have included a copy of the Welcome Letter that was sent on XX/XX/XXXX. '' This portion of the letter does not clarify the address to which the Welcome Letter was sent. I am requesting the specific address to which this letter was dispatched, as well as confirmation that I received it. Additionally, I want to highlight that the Welcome Letter Nelnet attached to the claim response appears to be from a webpage or email, but there is no proof that it was actually sent to any of my addresses, either physical or email. "" While your loan was in repayment, we sent you billing statements each month. When your account became past due, we also tried to reach you in other ways such as calling and sending both email and postal mail to help bring your account up to date. '' This section fails to specify which email address, phone number, or mailing address was used to contact me during the repayment period and when my account became past due.

My loans have been in repayment since XX/XX/XXXX. I was on IBR Plan until XX/XX/XXXX, when I was told to switch to SAVE Plan by my servicer EDFinancial. I was thrown into forbearance status XX/XX/XXXX, with no clear explanation, or options given. I read in XX/XX/XXXX that I should be allowed to go back on IBR Plan. I tried to switch back to IBR, and not be in forbearance in XX/XX/XXXX. I called EDFinancial and asked about going back to IBR XX/XX/XXXX. I was told I could, and the woman I spoke with asked my income and household size, said Id get an email. I didnt receive any correspondence from EDFinancial. I got on students.gov account and filled out an IDR app XX/XX/XXXX, requesting to go back onto IBR. That application status is still in review to date. The IDR forgiveness tracker graph on the students.gov account said I had a little over 2 years left of repayment, until I reached enough payments for IDR forgiveness. I called EDFinancial XX/XX/XXXX and was told all IDR apps were put on hold because of an injunction with SAVE Plan. I asked why IBR was being impacted, since its not SAVE. There are 5 IDR plans, not just SAVE. I received no resolve with my application. Around this time, the IDR application form was removed from the Dept of ED website, which was really concerning. I called EDFinancial XX/XX/XXXX and inquired about my IBR app again. I also requested a copy of my MPN. I called EDFinancial again XX/XX/XXXX as id not received the copy of my MPN, and to ask about my IBR app. I was told theyd mailed the MPN, it was sent out. I received an email notification from student aid.gov that said IDR apps would start getting processed again to contact your servicer, I believe this was around XX/XX/XXXX. I logged onto student aid.gov XX/XX/XXXX, and notice the graph for the IDR plan forgiveness payments had disappeared from my account homepage. I called students.gov, and she denied knowing anything about what IDR forgiveness info I was talking about, she told me to call my servicer for information on my loans. She told me I also had to keep filling out a new IDR app every time they paused and restarting processing the applications. I was in shock a bit. I then called EDFinancial to ask about my IDR app ( again ). A woman spoke with me. I asked if my IDR ( IBR ) app was any closer to being processed. She said theyre behind, and its taking a long time. She told me the apps have been put on hold three times beginning XX/XX/XXXX with the last time they started processing the apps again was XX/XX/XXXX. She put me on hold when I asked what happened to my IDR repayment forgiveness tracker info that was on my students.gov account. She returned, and told me that as of Friday ( XX/XX/XXXX ) the Dept of Ed told EDFinancial they were not allowed to discuss IDR forgiveness payments with borrowers. I said that was preposterous, and I asked for a statement of how many months if been in repayment. I was told a statement of my payments would be mailed, and could take up to 15 days. I also asked for a copy of my MPN ( for the third time ). I asked why Id not received it, after asking for it twice already. She said it was mailed to me XX/XX/XXXX. She told me shed ask for another copy of my MPN to get mailed to me, and it would also take up to 15 days. She told me I should be able to see it on my studentaid.gov account. I asked why I can not access it on my EDFinancial account. I can not access it on my students.gov account, either. It says theres no record of my MPN on my studentaid.gov account. I asked her why my IBR application was still not processed as its been almost 3 months since I submitted it. Ive been in forbearance for 9 months when I shouldve been in repayment due to no fault of my own, a court injunction with 1 of 5 available repayment options is causing this issue. I also read that the court may have had an opinion on ICR and PAYE. This still has nothing to do with IBR or PSLF. I can not get a copy of my XXXX from EDFinancial, and it says there is not record of if on my studentaid.gov account. My IDR repayment information has been disappeared from my students.gov account, and I was told by EDFinancial that they could not talk to anyone about IDR forgiveness or payments that had been made to count towards that ( by the DOE on XX/XX/XXXX ).

The actions taken by these parties, which I have reason to believe were conducted with or through your departments involvement, constitute a serious violation of federal and state privacy laws, including but not limited to the Right to Financial Privacy Act ( RFPA ), the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act ( GLBA ), and New Jerseys Consumer Fraud Act, among others. 

This unauthorized access of my financial data without my express consent is not only a breach of my privacy rights but also an egregious violation of multiple legal protections that safeguard consumer data.

I. VIOLATION OF FEDERAL PRIVACY LAWS Right to Financial Privacy Act ( RFPA ), 12 U.S.C. 3401 et seq.

The RFPA was designed to protect the privacy of personal financial information and restricts the unauthorized access of financial records by any government agency or third party. The actions of XXXX XXXX and Dodge in accessing my student loan records without my consent are a direct violation of this law. The RFPA requires that consumers be notified when their financial records are accessed, and in this case, no such notice was provided to me, further compounding the violation. 

Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act ( GLBA ), 15 U.S.C. 6801 et seq.

The GLBA mandates that financial institutions, including student loan servicers, establish privacy policies and procedures to safeguard consumers ' nonpublic personal information. The unauthorized access of my financial data by XXXX XXXX and Dodge constitutes a flagrant violation of the GLBA, as it has failed to protect my sensitive information. The act mandates consumer notification, which was not provided in this case. 

Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), 15 U.S.C. 1681 et seq.

The FCRA regulates the collection, dissemination, and use of consumer credit information. Unauthorized access to my financial information by third parties, including any disclosure to unauthorized parties, violates the provisions under the FCRA. Additionally, the student loan servicers failure to inform me of such actions or to properly safeguard my data further compounds these violations.

II. VIOLATION OF NEW JERSEY STATE LAWS New Jersey Consumer Fraud Act ( CFA ), N.J.S.A. 56:8-1 et seq.

Under the New Jersey Consumer Fraud Act, it is unlawful for businesses to engage in deceptive or fraudulent practices, including the unauthorized access of personal financial records. The unauthorized viewing of my financial data by XXXX XXXX and Dodge constitutes an unfair or deceptive practice under this statute. I demand that you take immediate action to rectify this breach, including the complete discharge of my XXXX XXXX  as per the terms that would have applied had this unauthorized access never occurred. 

New Jerseys Data Breach Notification Law, N.J.S.A. 56:8-161 et seq.

Under New Jersey 's Data Breach Notification Law, any entity that accesses a consumers personal financial information is required to notify that consumer within a reasonable time frame. I have not received such a notification and therefore demand an immediate explanation of how and why my private financial records were accessed, as well as the immediate removal of any such unauthorized access and the discharge of my XXXX XXXX 

New Jerseys Identity Theft Protection Act, N.J.S.A. 56:11-1 et seq.

Given the unauthorized access to my private financial records, I believe this incident could also be considered an act of identity theft under New Jerseys Identity Theft Protection Act. Any action or access by XXXX XXXX and Dodge is a direct violation of my right to privacy and protection under New Jersey law.

III. DEMAND FOR REMEDIAL ACTION Based on the unauthorized access of my financial records by XXXX XXXX and Dodge, I demand the following : Immediate discharge of my student loans, in accordance with the laws governing consumer protection and privacy rights, including but not limited to the RFPA, GLBA, FCRA, and New Jersey privacy laws. 

A full written explanation from your department detailing how and why XXXXXXXX XXXX and Dodge gained access to my financial records, and what actions have been taken to rectify this breach. 

A formal apology from both XXXXXXXX XXXX and Dodge for their unlawful actions, along with their acknowledgment of violating my privacy.

Immediate cessation of any further actions relating to the collection or servicing of these loans, and the removal of any and all negative credit reporting related to this debt from my credit reports.

Full restitution of any fees or charges applied to my account as a result of this unlawful breach of privacy.

A copy of all internal communications within your department and with XXXX XXXX and Dodge regarding my student loan account and any access to my private financial records.

If I do not receive a satisfactory response to this demand within 10 business days of receipt of this letter, I will take all necessary legal actions to pursue civil damages, including seeking a lawsuit for breach of privacy, violations of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ), and any other relevant claims.

The mishandling of my student loan account, the unauthorized and inappropriate disclosure of my information, and the resulting negative impact on my credit report. 

According to EdFinancial Services published policy, they are only authorized by law to provide information concerning your education loan account to your school and the U.S. Department of Education ( for any federal loans ). However, my credit report reflects adverse information related to my student loans that appears to have been disclosed or reported in a manner inconsistent with this policy and without proper notice or written consent. 

This disclosure violates 20 U.S. Code 1232g ( FERPA ), which governs the privacy of student education records and limits disclosure of personally identifiable information without the students consent, except under narrow legal exceptions. I did not provide such consent, and I was not informed that my data would be shared with third parties in a way that could damage my credit. 

In addition, this situation raises concerns under 20 U.S. Code 1092, which mandates that institutions and their agents must clearly disclose all terms of student loans, including repayment obligations, grace periods, and the consequences of default or late payment. If I had not been properly informed of how and when credit damage could occur - or if disclosures were ambiguous or incomplete- this would constitute a failure to meet federal disclosure requirements. 

Under The Fair Credit Reporting Act, 15 U.S. Code 1681, specifically, the account reported by EdFinancial Services relating to my student loans is inaccurate and misleading and was reported without proper disclosure and authorization. The information on this account, including late payment history does not reflect accurate or complete information and has been reported in violation of FCRA. 

If I do not receive a response within 15 days, I will proceed to file formal complaints with the U.S. Department of Education, including the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) and the Federal Student Aid Group. I also reserve the right to pursue further legal remedies as needed. 

I appreciate your immediate attention to this matter and look forward to your prompt response.

I respectfully reject your conclusion that Nelnet has not engaged in unauthorized or unlawful activity, and I reiterate the legal basis and evidence supporting my concerns. 

Statutory Violations and Oversight 1. Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act ( FERPA ) 20 U.S.C. 1232g ; 34 CFR Part 99 As a borrower, my federal student loan records are classified as protected education records under FERPA. Unauthorized access, review, or disclosure of my financial aid data without my written consent is a clear violation of 34 CFR 99.30 and constitutes a breach of privacy.

2. Privacy Act of 1974 5 U.S.C. 552a As a federal loan servicer contracted by the U.S. Department of Education ( ED ), Nelnet is subject to the Privacy Acts provisions. The act mandates that all systems of records containing personal data be safeguarded against unauthorized access or disclosure. Your statement that consent is granted only when lawful and necessary lacks documentation showing compliance with 552a ( b ) and ( e ) ( 10 ). I request to review audit logs and security measures related to this data access.

3. Breach of Contract I entered into a binding loan agreement with the reasonable expectation that Nelnet and the Department of Education would take all necessary steps to safeguard my sensitive data. Unauthorized accesswhether by internal actors, affiliates, or outside entities like XXXX XXXX XXXX as suspected ) constitutes a breach of fiduciary and contractual duty. 
4. Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) 15 U.S.C. 16811681x If any financial data or records were accessed or viewed by an unauthorized entity without a permissible purpose, that is a violation of 15 U.S.C. 1681b ( f ) and subject to enforcement by the CFPB.

5. Federal Information Security Modernization Act ( FISMA ) & OMB Circular A-130 As a federal contractor managing personally identifiable information ( PII ), Nelnet is required to adhere to the safeguards and audit procedures under FISMA and OMB Circular A-130. Your statement does not address whether security logs have been reviewed or if a breach report was filed with ED. 



Formal Demands Under Federal Law In accordance with FERPA, the Privacy Act, and other applicable statutes, I am demanding the following : 1. A full audit trail of all users and entities who accessed my account data from XX/XX/XXXX to present. 
2. Disclosure of any data breach reports or unauthorized access incidents involving my loan data.

3. Clarification of data retention practices, security measures, and breach notification protocols in line with 552a ( e ) ( 10 ). 
4. Determination of contract breach eligibility for discharge, per borrower defense regulations under 34 CFR 685.206 ( c ).

5. Legal basis for denial of remedy, if applicable, including why breach-based forgiveness was not considered.

Notice of Escalation If these issues are not fully addressed within 30 days of receipt, I will pursue further escalation with the Student Privacy Policy Office, Federal Student Aid Ombudsman Group, CFPB, Department of Education Office of Inspector General, and, if necessary, legal counsel. 

Your response, while acknowledging the concern, is legally insufficient. Nelnets duty is not only to comply with laws but to demonstrate compliance through verifiable actions and transparent reporting.

This breach constitutes a direct violation of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act ( FERPA ) and Title IV regulations, as well as an egregious violation of my personal privacy and financial security.

I recently discovered that my sensitive and legally protected records were accessed and potentially shared without my consent. This includes but is not limited to : 1. My academic records and personally identifiable information ( PII ).

2. My Free Application for Federal Student Aid ( FAFSA ) data, including financial aid history and loan information.

3. My IRS tax transcripts, which were obtained and used without proper authorization.

These actions violate my rights under FERPA ( 20 U.S.C. 1232g ; 34 CFR Part 99 ), which grants me the right to control access to my educational records, as well as Title IV of the Higher Education Act, which governs the use and protection of federal student aid information. Furthermore, unauthorized access to my IRS tax data raises serious concerns regarding potential identity theft, fraud, and violations of federal data security standards.

Given the severity of this breach and the direct impact on my financial security and privacy, I demand the following corrective actions : 1. Immediate discharge and cancellation of all my federal student loans due to the breach of my financial aid and tax records, which invalidates the integrity of my loan agreements.

2. A formal investigation into this data breach, including details on how my records were accessed, who accessed them, and for what purpose.

3. A full report on the extent of my data exposure and the corrective measures being implemented to prevent future violations.

4. Immediate notification to all major credit bureaus ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ) to place a fraud alert and investigate any unauthorized activity that may have resulted from this breach.

This breach has caused significant distress and concern regarding the security of my personal and financial data. If my demands are not met within 30 days, I will be left with no choice but to escalate this matter through legal channels, including filing complaints with the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ), the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ), and pursuing legal action against the responsible parties.

I request a written response addressing these concerns and outlining the immediate actions being taken to remedy this situation. Please direct all correspondence to the address listed above.

Violation of FERPA and Privacy Act Rights Unauthorized Access to My Educational Data Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing to formally file a complaint regarding a serious breach of my privacy and violation of my rights under both the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act ( FERPA ) and the Privacy Act of 1974 ( 5 U.S.C. 552a ). It has come to my attention that my personal and sensitive information, including my Social Security Number ( SSN ) and financial status, was accessed without my consent by individuals who should not have had access to it. Specifically, I believe that XXXX XXXX and XXXX  ( Doge ), a cryptocurrency-related entity, have unlawfully obtained and accessed my educational records stored by the Department of Education XXXX 
I have not provided any consent for such individuals or entities to review or use my data. This breach of my private information is alarming, and I demand an immediate investigation into this unauthorized access. 
As per FERPA, my educational records, including personally identifiable information, are protected from unauthorized disclosure. Further, under the Privacy Act of 1974 ( 5 U.S.C. 552a ), personal data maintained by federal agencies such as the Department of Education must not be disclosed without my consent, except under specific and limited circumstances. The act also outlines that agencies must establish safeguards to ensure the privacy of such data. Clearly, this breach represents a violation of both FERPA and the Privacy Act, and I believe that immediate corrective action is necessary.

The following actions are requested : 1. Investigation : An immediate inquiry into how and why my educational records were accessed by XXXX XXXX and XXXX without my permission, in violation of FERPA and the Privacy Act.

2. Clarification of Access : A detailed explanation of the process that allowed these parties to access sensitive data such as my SSN and financial details, in breach of the legal protections afforded to me under both FERPA and the Privacy Act.

3. Corrective Action : Steps to rectify the breach and ensure that such unauthorized access does not occur again in the future. This includes taking measures to enhance safeguards as mandated by 5 U.S.C. 552a.

4. Notification : Confirmation of the individuals or entities that have viewed or obtained my information and clarification on how my data has been used, in violation of both the Privacy Act and FERPA. 
I trust that the Department of Education takes these legal concerns seriously and will uphold my privacy rights in accordance with both FERPA and the Privacy Act. I expect a prompt response and resolution of this matter. Please contact me at the provided phone number or email address with updates on the status of the investigation.

04/24/25,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Received bad information about your loan,"Subject : Follow-Up to CFPB Complaint # XXXX Discrepancies, Fraud Concerns, and Inadequate Validation of Federal Loan To Whom It May Concern, I am writing to submit an updated and urgent follow-up to my complaint under case number XXXX regarding an alleged student loan serviced by Aidvantage. 

While the loan is claimed to fall under the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, and I have received a Master Promissory Note ( MPN ) as validation, I must emphasize that this documentation does not adequately validate the debt as legally mine for the following reasons : 1. Name Discrepancy and Identity Concerns The MPN Aidvantage provided lists the name "" XXXX XXXX '', which does not match my legal name, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX used in all my official and financial documentation, including Secretary of State records . 
This inconsistency raises a serious concern regarding potential identity confusion or fraud, particularly in light of historical fraud issues related to XXXX XXXX, where this loan is allegedly connected. 

2. MPN Is Not Sufficient Debt Validation While the MPN is a required form under federal student loan programs, it does not, by itself, prove current ownership, standing, or servicing rights. It is a general form that anyone with identifying information could potentially sign, and does not : Prove I signed it, Confirm my consent to this specific loan, Show that the debt is still owed and collectible, or XXXX Aidvantage as a legal party authorized to collect.

Federal law requires debt collectors including federal loan servicers to validate debts upon dispute, especially where there are concerns of fraud, identity mismatch, or payment errors. 

3. Potential Fraud and Misrepresentation The MPN itself states under False Certification and Unauthorized Payments that borrowers may be discharged from loan obligations in cases of : Identity theft, Falsified signatures, Fraudulent certification by the school, and Situations where the borrower did not attend the school or did not benefit from the program. 

XXXX XXXX the institution linked to this loan has a documented history of irregularities and possible fraud. Given the time period ( XXXX ), and that I attended for only six months and understood the balance was paid in full, I am asserting my right to request : A full and itemized payment history, Proof of loan disbursement, Verification of the identity and authorization used to originate the loan, and A statement confirming Aidvantages legal servicing rights. 

4. Right to Dispute and Protection Under Federal Law As a borrower, I am protected by federal law, including : The Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ) ( where applicable ), The Higher Education Act of 1965, and The Federal Trade Commission Act, particularly in cases involving potential misrepresentation or fraud. 

Requested Actions : I request that the CFPB compel Aidvantage to provide : Full documentation verifying that the loan is connected to my legal identity ( XXXX XXXX ) ; Clear proof of loan disbursement and servicing rights ; A complete transaction and payment history ; Documentation to confirm the loan remains valid and unpaid ; and A response to the possibility of false certification or identity misuse under federal loan discharge conditions.

My loans have been in a no-interest forbearance period since the onset of the XXXX relief measures in XXXX. 

However, I recently observed an increase of {$640.00} in my principal balance, which appears to be a result of interest capitalization. Prior to the transfer, my loan balance was {$49000.00}, and there should have been no interest accrual or capitalization during the federally mandated forbearance period. 

On XX/XX/year>, I contacted EdFinancial to request a correction to this error. I also filed a formal complaint with XXXX regarding the matter. Unfortunately, I have not received a response or seen any corrective action taken to date. 

This adjustment appears to be a clear error, as the forbearance provisions under the XXXX XXXX and subsequent extensions specified that no interest would accrue during the relief period. Therefore, no capitalization should have occurred upon transfer or resumption of payments. 

Additionally, Ive encountered repeated errors when attempting to make payments through EdFinancials online portal. Specifically, the system has failed multiple times to process my auto-debit payment, without any clear communication or notification that payments were not going through.

For the last 15 years, I have tried DOZENS of times to dispute the amount that the student loan people have been charging me. 

I graduated college in XXXX and my wife, likewise, graduated in XXXX. Shortly thereafter, we combined our loans. In XXXX, I even went through bankruptcy and was told student loans were off-limits. I am a XXXX XXXX and have good number-sense, so in the early XXXX 's, I felt that the interest and totals I was being charged for were inaccurate. I started making calls and got nowhere. 

Not knowing the details of the law, in about XXXX, I wrote a letter asking if this was something that could be settled ( like an IRS bill ), explaining that I was nearing retirement age and may be no longer able to pay the full amount, to which I never received a reply. 

In XXXX, my wife applied for and was approved for a XXXX discharge. After the payments were resumed, there was no lowering of the amount of our combined loan. I made several calls about this and asked for proof that my wife 's portion of the loans were actually discharged from our combined loan. 

In XXXX, they sent me a redacted promissory note that shows all of the individual loans that were added to the combined loan, but any dates or colleges that they are tied appear to be redated. I made literally dozens of calls since that time that got nowhere. 

When I bought my current house in XXXX and again when I refinanced in XXXX, I even had to have the student loan people verify to the mortgage loan people that my loans were in dispute so that I could obtain those loans. 

After my loan was transferred to another servicer - YET AGAIN - I asked for proof and they sent me the same exact redacted promissory note. 

Because of the runaround, and the multiple changes to my loan servicer over the years, it is my feeling that the student loan people have no way to actually prove the exact total of student loans, an accurate accounting of any payments I have made, an accurate accounting of interest accumulated, nor any proof that my wife 's loans were actually removed from the account. 

In the civilian world, this would be grounds for breach of contract and voiding of the loan ( s ). I've had several lawyers tell me I have an easy case to win, but I do not have the means to do so, so I am depending on you fine folks to make this situation right.

Violations of CFPB Jurisdiction Include : Consumer Financial Protection Act ( CFPA ) 12 U.S.C. 5531 XXXX 's failure to disclose accurate loan classification and their inaction constitute deceptive and unfair practices.

The lack of communication and accountability from both parties has negatively impacted my credit and caused considerable confusion and stress. 

When I attended college, I took out federal student loans serviced by XXXX. I consistently made payments on time and maintained a good standing with my account. However, in XXXX, XXXX ceased servicing federal student loans. After this transition, I was no longer able to access my XXXX account, and I received no further communication regarding the status of my loan or its transfer to another servicer. 

In the fall of XXXX, during a routine credit check, I noticed that my student loan was now being reported under Aidvantage. I immediately contacted Aidvantage and provided my information, but they were unable to locate any account under my name. They advised me to contact Federal Student Aid ( FAFSA ), which confirmed that I did, in fact, have an account with Aidvantage. FAFSA informed me that I would need to contact Aidvantage again to resolve the matter. I did so, but once again, Aidvantage could not find my account. 

Fast forward to XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX noticing that my credit score had dropped by XXXX pointsI called Aidvantage again. According to my credit report, my account had been current through XX/XX/XXXX. However, by XXXX, it was marked as 90 days past due, which is not chronologically possible. To my surprise, Aidvantage was now able to locate my account. I explained the entire situation and was informed that they had been servicing my loan since XX/XX/XXXX. This was extremely concerning to me, as I had received no communication during that time to notify me of the transfer. 

When I asked why they couldnt find my account during my earlier calls in the fall, I was told repeatedly that they had sent communications via phone and email. However, I never received any such messages. The only communications I had with Aidvantage were ones that I initiated. It felt as though they were shifting the blame rather than acknowledging the issue.

After getting nowhere with the initial representative, I requested to speak with a supervisor. I once again explained the entire situation and asked if anything could be done to remedy the situation so that I would not be penalized for something outside of my control. The supervisor told me that Aidvantage does not charge late fees, and that the only increase in the loan amount was due to accrued interest. They were able to remove a pending {$200.00} payment so that my account would be brought current, although this did not reduce the balance of the loan.

I requested that the accrued interest be waived given the lack of communication and inability to access my account, but was told that Aidvantage could not do this, as they are only the loan servicer and not the loan owner. I was advised to contact FAFSA for any adjustments to interest. The representative also helped me regain access to my online account so that I could resume payments.

After this, I called FAFSA to inquire about having the interest removed. The first representative I spoke to stated that they do not handle financial aspects of loans and that only the servicerAidvantagecould address that matter. He remarked that it seemed like Aidvantage was mishandling my account, as evidenced by their earlier inability to locate it. He transferred me to another department that handles issues like mine.

The second representative I spoke to stated that Aidvantage does in fact own my loan and does have the authority to reduce or remove the accrued interest. She also told me that I could and should file a
formal complaint with the Department of Education via StudentAid.gov, as well as with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ). That is the purpose of this letter.

Upon conducting further research, I discovered that I am not alone. Many other former XXXX borrowers have experienced similar issuesonly learning of the transfer to Aidvantage through a credit check, rather than direct communication. I also found an article from the CFPB which details how XXXX was banned from servicing federal student loans and was ordered to pay {$120.00} XXXX for widespread lending failures ( https : //www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/XXXX ).

I have made every effort to resolve this matter responsibly and in good faith. I was unaware of the transfer, was denied access to my account for years, and was given conflicting information by the servicer. Despite finally resolving the account status, my credit score dropped XXXX points in less than a month and will take significant time to recover. This situation was entirely out of my control, and I should not be penalized for the lack of transparency and communication from XXXX and Aidvantage.

See 34 C.F.R. 682.410 ; 34 C.F.R. 682.411. For example, after a borrower misses a payment, the lender must send at least one written notice or collection letter to the borrower within 15 days that notifies the borrower of the delinquency. Mohela DID NOT SEND A LETTER UNTIL my account was 186 days past due.

34 C.F.R. 682.411 ( c ). If the debtor is still delinquent after 15 days, the lender must send four collection letters to the borrower and make four diligent efforts to contact the borrower by telephone ; one telephone contact must occur on or before the 90th day of delinquency, one must occur after the 90th day of delinquency, and at least two of the collection letters must warn the borrower that if the loan is not paid, the default will be reported to all national credit bureaus.

I moved states and had two different addresses in the past couple years. I attempted to access my NelNet account several times last year online throughout the year to update my moving information, but the NelNet online account system was down for several months at least ( in hindsight, I recognize that I should've taken screenshots every time I attempted access ).

I had also previously set up a monthly payment plan with my student loans before they were paused. I had the same bank account, so I assumed whenever they restarted it would be withdrawn from my account as before. For some reason, they were canceled and therefore did not realize this either. When I could finally access my online account, I realize Nelnet notified me via account inbox and mailing, however due to address changes and no access to the online account system, once again since the online system was down, I never received this notice. 

I understand it is fully my responsibility to update contact information and to make timely payments for my loan account. I fully intend to abide by this loan policy, and otherwise have near excellent payment history with creditors ( attached credit report ) with the rare exception of an automatic payment hiccup- however, I'll always immediately fix the issue the moment I become aware of it.

After some time, I found out through a direct conversation with my actual federal loan servicer, XXXX, that Debteaze submitted false information on my income-driven repayment ( IDR ) application. 

Specifically, they falsely claimed I had two dependents, when I have zero. I never authorized them to include this false information. I was never asked or made aware that they would be submitting that claim. 

I also requested a full refund, but they denied it even after I pointed out that their application was built on falsehoods. They now claim I only made one payment to them, but I have proof of additional payments. 

They are threatening to send me to collections even though their actions were misleading and potentially fraudulent. Their customer service insisted cancellation can only be done by phone, which I refused because their phone tactics are confusing and pressure-based.

This error, combined with their disorganized handling, is causing financial stress and potential harm to my loan status. 
Background : I graduated with a XXXX XXXX in XXXX and consolidated multiple federal loansXXXX HEAL loans ( XXXX to XXXX ), XXXX Perkins, XXXX SLS XXXX and XXXX subsidized Stafford loansinto a FFELP Consolidation Loan ( loan XXXX ) in the late XXXX. XXXX lists loan XXXX as FFELP Consolidated, and MOHELAs records show loans XXXX to XXXX as HEAL, {$0.00}, Consolidated and Paid in Full, confirming the late XXXX FFELP consolidation. Ive maintained half-time enrollment ( XXXX credits, cash-paid ) at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX XXXX for over XXXX  years, qualifying for in-school deferment under FFELP regulations ( 34 CFR 682.210 ( b ) ( 1 ) ), which require only half-time status with no time limit. 
Issue : MOHELA insists loan XXXX is a Smart Consolidation HEAL Loan requiring full-time enrollment for deferment, a nonexistent loan type not recognized by federal regulations or XXXX. They set its deferment to end in XX/XX/XXXX without the standard FFELP XXXX grace period ( 34 CFR 682.210 ( b ) ( 3 ) ), unlike my other FFELP loans ( XXXX, XXXX ), which are deferred until XX/XX/XXXX with a XXXX grace period for XXXX clearinghouse verification of my half-time status. This misclassification began after XXXX transferred my loans to MOHELA in XXXX, likely a data error from the transition. 
Actions Taken : XX/XX/XXXX : I emailed MOHELA, stating loan XXXX is FFELP Consolidated, not HEAL, citing studentaid.gov and their own XXXX {$0.00} HEAL records. I noted XXXX years of half-time deferment by XXXX XXXX ( XXXX XXXX ) and Navient ( XXXX ) and that loans XXXX and XXXX are half-time deferred. I requested correction and warned of Ombudsman escalation. 
XX/XX/XXXX : XXXX claimed # XXXX smart HEAL, promised a letter to clear things up after escalation. 
XX/XX/XXXX : Received a notice ( researching reply if appropriate ). Calledanother representative said # XXXX, # XXXX stay deferred ( XXXX a grace period ), but # XXXX ends XXXX ( HEAL, no grace ). She admitted # XXXX might be FFELP, apologized, but said Id need to call back for deferment if corrected. She noted NSLDS shows a XXXX graduation date and suggested a Summer XXXX class ( not my normFalls enough ) to secure deferment by XXXX. Theyre waiting a reply from a registry email ( escalation or NSLDS ). 
XX/XX/XXXX Email : MOHELA responded, reiterating # XXXX a Smart HEAL Loan needing full-time enrollmentincorrect. I replied, restating # XXXX FFELP Consolidated status, studentaid.gov, XXXX {$0.00} HEALs, XXXX years half-time, and demanded correction or Ombudsman action. Got an auto-reply ( high email volume respond soon ). 
Harm Caused : MOHELAs errormisclassifying # XXXX and ending deferment prematurelythreatens financial strain, as I rely on half-time deferment ( LAVC, XXXX credits, cash-paid ) to manage payments. Their disorganized responses ( waiting registry email, vague notice, auto-reply ) and inconsistent process ( unlike XXXX XXXX/XXXX  seamless deferments ) cause stress and uncertainty. Loans XXXX, XXXX correct half-time treatment proves # XXXX should matchMOHELAs glitch is unjustified. 
Requested Resolution : 1. Correct loan XXXX status to FFELP Consolidated, as per studentaid.gov and MOHELAs XXXX records. 
2. Reinstate in-school deferment for half-time enrollment ( XXXX credits, LAVC, Spring/Summer XXXX ), matching loans XXXX, XXXX, with FFELPs XXXX grace period.

Despite repeated contact and documentation, TransUnion has failed to uphold its obligations under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and industry-standard Metro XXXX compliance procedures. 
Background : Over the course of several months, I have submitted multiple disputes and inquiries to TransUnion concerning the accuracy and reporting status of my XXXX account. Despite receiving XXXX vague, non-committal emails from TransUnion stating they are looking into it, there has been no evidence of a proper reinvestigation or corrective action, in direct violation of federal law. 
In addition to contacting TransUnion directly, I have filed formal written complaints and submitted evidence to : The United States Senate and Congressional Representatives The Attorney Generals Office The Consumer Protection Division The U.S. Department of Education, including the Office of General Counsel Federal Student Aid ( FSA ) Complaint Center XXXX and TransUnion ( via email and certified mail ) Furthermore, I submitted an application for the Loan Discharge Request ( XXXX ) in XX/XX/year>, which has remained in "" review '' status without any decision, updates, or correspondence from XXXX.

To date, I have submitted a total of XXXX XXXX applications and XXXX formal Discharge application seeking relief. None of these have been responded to or processed properly. Meanwhile, TransUnion continues to report inaccurate and incomplete information about this account without verifying its accuracy or properly documenting the ongoing disputes and discharge requests. 

Legal Violations : XXXX. Failure to Conduct a Reasonable Reinvestigation FCRA 611 ( 15 U.S.C. 1681i ) requires CRAs to conduct a reasonable reinvestigation when a consumer disputes information. TransUnion has failed to comply by providing no detailed response or outcome while continuing to report disputed data. 
XXXX. Failure to Maintain Procedural Accuracy FCRA 607 ( b ) ( 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ) ) TransUnion is required to maintain procedures to ensure maximum possible accuracy of consumer data. Reporting a defaulted XXXX account despite a pending discharge/LDR application demonstrates procedural failure and negligence. 
XXXX. Metro 2 Compliance Violations Under Metro 2 reporting standards, furnishers and CRAs must correctly reflect dispute codes, deferment/forbearance status, and discharge claims. TransUnion has failed to apply the appropriate codes or suppress reporting while the dispute is ongoing. 
XXXX. Negligent and Willful Noncompliance FCRA 616 & 617 ( 15 U.S.C. 1681n, 1681o ) TransUnion has demonstrated both negligence and willful disregard for the law by continuing to report inaccurate information and failing to correct or investigate the errors, despite ample notice Requested Resolution : Immediate reinvestigation of the XXXX account, with full validation of data and detailed documentation of the source. 

Immediate correction or removal of any XXXX tradeline inaccurately reported in violation of the FCRA and XXXX XXXX guidelines.

An official written response from TransUnion outlining their investigation and confirming full compliance with legal obligations. 

Referral or enforcement action by the CFPB for TransUnions consistent failure to follow the FCRA and industry standards.

Despite maintaining active autopay and making every scheduled monthly loan payment, Heartland ECSI reported me as delinquent for XX/XX/XXXX. This delinquency is unfair, inaccurate, and caused by servicing failures, not borrower fault. 

Here are the facts : I have made every required $ 40 monthly payment on time through active autopay, including XX/XX/XXXX. 
In XXXX, Heartland previously mishandled my payments they failed to process a payment despite my bank information being valid. I contacted their customer service last year through phone, made an additional {$40.00} payment by phone to cover any late fee or outstanding balance, and was assured that the issue was resolved. 
Despite this, Heartland failed to process my payment and again claimed a balance due from a late fee without properly charging my active autopay account or notifying me effectively beyond mailing letters. 
I reasonably believed that my account was in good standing because I continued to make my required loan payments and had valid bank information on file for automatic payments. 
At no time did I intentionally miss any loan payment or receive real-time electronic notice that additional manual payment was needed. 

Even if a small late fee existed, the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and servicer guidance make clear that borrowers who are current on their scheduled payments should not be reported delinquent solely for administrative fees. 

Heartlands actions failing to process payments correctly, failing to clear balances after extra payments, and then improperly reporting me delinquent are servicing errors that have unfairly damaged my credit score. 

I am requesting that Heartland ECSI : Immediately correct my account to reflect no delinquency.

Assuming there was fraudulent activity, I immediately filed a report with XXXX to investigate. The report revealed that Nelnet had posted 16 delinquent payments to my accountall on the same day. 

Confused, I contacted Nelnet and learned that they had taken over my student loans from Great Lakes. Under Great Lakes, I was enrolled in an income-driven deferment program due to unemployment, meaning I was not required to make payments. However, when Nelnet assumed control of my loans, they removed my deferment status without notifying me. Complicating matters further, I had originally three loans with Great Lakes, but Nelnet reorganized them into 16 separate accounts, drastically increasing the impact of their reporting. 

Since I had moved out of state, I never received any mail from Nelnet, leaving me completely unaware of the situation. I was also unable to set up an online account with them initially, as my address did not match what they had on file. After persistent efforts, I finally gained access to my Nelnet account and started receiving correspondence. 

Adding to my frustration, I discovered that Nelnet is currently facing multiple class-action lawsuits for similar issues. When I asked them for details about my loan transition, they could not provide any information about my original Great Lakes balances or interest rates. Since Great Lakes is no longer in service, I have no way of verifying my previous records.

The first time I called, the customer representative said she verified that I was a full-time student and would put a request to change my loan status.

The status was never changed. Today I called, approximately two weeks after the first call, and the customer service representative this time said I was not a full-time student. This does not make any sense since it is within the SAME semester.

My information was among that dataset that has been compromised. 

Dear CFPB, I am writing to formally dispute my federal student loans and request a full discharge due to a serious breach of my personal and financial information. My information was compromised without my authorization, which violates multiple federal laws designed to protect student records and personal privacy. 

Under these circumstances, I request the immediate cancellation and discharge of my student loan debt in full, as my rights have been severely violated. Below are the key reasons for my request : Violation of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act ( FERPA ) : My student records were disclosed without my consent, violating FERPAs strict confidentiality protections.

Breach of the Privacy Act of 1974 : My personal and financial information was improperly accessed and shared without my authorization, violating my privacy rights under federal law.

Violation of the Higher Education Act : As a student loan borrower, my information should have been protected, but the mishandling of my data demonstrates a failure to uphold these legal protections.

Breach of Contract and Negligence : The entity responsible for safeguarding my data failed to do so, putting my financial security at risk.

Unauthorized Disclosure to Third Parties : It has come to my attention that personal borrower information has been shared with unauthorized entities, including XXXX XXXX, constituting a severe breach of trust and professional responsibility. 

These violations have caused significant distress and potential long-term harm to my creditworthiness and financial future. I am requesting the following actions be taken immediately : 1. Full discharge and cancellation of all associated student loan debt.

2. Immediate removal of this account from all credit reporting agencies.

3. A full investigation and explanation regarding how my data was mishandled, including all parties who had access to or received my information.

4. Written confirmation of the outcome of this dispute.

Please consider this letter a formal complaint and request under all applicable federal protections. I expect a timely and comprehensive response in accordance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), the Privacy Act, and any other relevant legislation. 

If no resolution is provided, I reserve the right to escalate this matter to the U.S. Department of Education, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ), and other appropriate legal channels.

05/10/25,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Received bad information about your loan,"To Whom It May Concern : This matter is directly connected to the following formal complaints I filed with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) regarding unlawful actions taken by Aidvantage and the U.S. Department of Education : Case # XXXX # XXXX # XXXX Each of these complaints documents a repeated and systemic failure by your organization to act in good faith, comply with federal lending laws or provide proper validation of the alleged debt. Despite my numerous attempts to resolve the issue through lawful channels, Aidvantage and the Department of Education have continued to enforce a debt that is both factually and legally invalid. This is no longer a mere disputeit is a documented pattern of unlawful enforcement and ongoing harm. 
I am issuing this legal notice to put your office on formal record. This student loan account, allegedly serviced by Aidvantage, does not belong to me. The contract associated with the account is not legally binding, and I reject any attempt to attach it to my name or financial records.

Key Legal Violations and Supporting Facts : 1. The Account Was Paid in Full and the School Committed Fraud The alleged loan was fully paid in 2008.

The school that received the funds was shut down for fraud, which qualifies the loan for full discharge under Borrower Defense to Repayment ( 34 CFR 685.206 ). 
Despite this, your office has continued to report and enforce this invalid account for over 15 years, which constitutes consumer abuse and actionable federal harm. 
XXXX. The Promissory Note Is Fraudulent and Unenforceable The promissory note does not contain my legal name and was not signed by me. 
I never consented to the terms and conditions of repayment. 
No repayment schedule, interest rate, or total obligation was disclosed to me as required by the Truth in Lending Act ( TILA 1631 ).

A contract can not be enforced without mutual agreement, full disclosure, and proof of consent.

3. No Legal Validation or Verification Provided I have repeatedly requested all documents required by law to validate the debt. You have failed to provide : A wet-ink original signed contract, A lawful chain of assignment, A complete disbursement history, Or any verifiable proof that I owe this alleged debt. Under FCRA 1681s-2, reporting unverifiable deb
t is illegal.

Under RESPA 2605 ( e ), failure to respond to a Qualified Written Request is a federal violation.

4. I Will Not Submit a Fraud ReportThis Is Not My Debt Demanding that I file a police report or fraud affidavit implies guilt for an act I did not commit. 
I will not file any document that could be used against me to legitimize a false claim. 
Under the XXXX Amendment, I can not be compelled to make any self-incriminating statement. 
The burden of proof lies on the creditornot the consumer. 
XXXX. XXXX XXXX and XXXX Protocols Violated The account is not being reported in compliance with the XXXX XXXX credit reporting format. 
The dispute has not been resolved using the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( CDIA ) XXXX protocol. 
You are knowingly and willfully misreporting a legally disputed and invalid debt. 
XXXX. Continuous Damage Since 2008 Legal Basis for Federal Suit I have experienced financial loss, credit damage, emotional distress, and ongoing harm due to your illegal enforcement. 
You are in violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ), the Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ), and the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act ( RESPA ). 
I reserve the right to file a federal lawsuit and pursue maximum civil damages and injunctive relief. 
Formal Legal Demands : Cease and desist all collection and enforcement activities immediately. 
Discharge and void the alleged loan account under applicable federal law. 
Permanently remove any reference to this account from my credit reports with XX/XX/XXXX 
Provide written confirmation within XXXX business days that the account has been removed and no further actions will be taken. 
Issue a formal written apology acknowledging the error, harm, and unlawful conduct.

Specifically, I have become aware that my sensitive personal and educational information has been improperly accessed, used, and/or disclosed without my consent. The following concerns are at the center of this complaint : 1. Violation of 15 U.S.C. 1681 ( FCRA ) : My consumer report information appears to have been accessed or shared without permissible purpose, in direct violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act. 
I did not provide consent for such inquiries or disclosures, and I was not notified of these actions as required by law.

Inaccurate information may have been reported and/or used in decision-making processes affecting my creditworthiness, employment opportunities, or other vital matters, constituting a breach of my rights under the FCRA.

2. Violation of FERPA : My educational records, or personally identifiable information contained within them, appear to have been disclosed without my explicit written consent.

These unauthorized disclosures violate FERPA regulations, which mandate that such information remains confidential unless prior consent is provided or unless a specific exception applies. 
To date, I have not been provided with any satisfactory explanation or record of these disclosures, despite my request for full access and accounting of my education records as FERPA entitles me.

The mishandling of my personal, financial, and educational information has caused me significant distress and has potentially impacted my opportunities and reputation. I respectfully request that the responsible parties conduct a full and immediate investigation into these violations. I also request that I be provided with : A full accounting of any and all instances in which my records and personal data were accessed, shared, or used.

Remediation of any inaccurate or improperly disclosed information.

Assurance of compliance with federal law moving forward, including corrective action plans.

Please consider this letter a formal complaint. If necessary, I am prepared to escalate this matter to the appropriate regulatory authorities, including the U.S. Department of Education for FERPA violations and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) for FCRA violations.

I appreciate your prompt attention to this serious matter and expect a written response within [ 15/30 ] days of receipt of this letter.

Despite the federal student loan forbearance in place at the timewhich clearly paused payments, interest, and collection activitiesMOHELA attempted to collect payment from me. This action was in direct conflict with the terms of the federal pause. Furthermore, my loan account has since been negatively reported to credit bureaus based on these improper collection attempts, causing harm to my credit standing. 

To make matters worse, my loan was transferred from a previous servicer to MOHELA without my knowledge or consent, and I did not receive any official notification of the transfer. As a result, I was left unaware of any changes in account status or payment expectations, further complicating the situation and increasing the potential for errors and misunderstandings. 

These actions by MOHELA appear to violate consumer protections and the terms of the federal student loan relief measures. I am requesting that the CFPB investigate this matter, ensure any inaccurate credit reporting is corrected, and hold MOHELA accountable for any non-compliant or deceptive practices. 

Please let me know what additional documentation or information you may require from me to move forward with this complaint.

04/02/25,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Problem with customer service,"Thank you for reviewing my concerns. I respectfully disagree with the assertion that nothing was reported late on Aidvantages end, as it disregards the core issue : incorrect and inconsistent reporting of my repayment start date. 

My final coursework in the University XXXX  Georgia XXXX XXXX program concluded in summer XXXX, and my degree was conferred on XX/XX/XXXX. Despite this, Aidvantage incorrectly relied on a XX/XX/XXXX graduation date, as reported in an earlier data transfer, and initiated repayment with a due date of XXXX XXXXwithout verifying the updated NSLDS information. This misalignment led to the wrongful early start of my repayment period. 

I proactively worked with the University of Georgia to correct the record. On XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX, Senior Assistant Registrar, confirmed that UGA  manually updated the graduation date in the NSLDS Clearinghouse to reflect my summer XXXX graduation term. This means Aidvantage has access to the correct data and still failed to adjust my grace period or repayment terms accordingly. 

Aidvantages statement that "" there is no negative reporting '' is misleading. While they may not have marked payments as formally delinquent, the incorrect repayment start date has affected the accounts age, status, and monthly payment history, which are critical components of credit scoring models used by mortgage underwriters, financial institutions, etc. The impact is not limited to delinquencyaccuracy matters. 

Despite calls and emails, including my direct outreach to my assigned representative, XXXX, I have not received confirmation that : Aidvantage received and processed the corrected NSLDS data ; My grace period has been properly reinstated ; My repayment start date has been realigned with the correct graduation date ; My credit file has been updated to reflect these changes. 

Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), furnishers of credit information have a legal obligation to report accurate and complete information. Whether a late payment is marked or not, the inaccurate reporting of account status, timing, or terms still constitutes a violation of that obligation.",None,"Maximus Federal Services, Inc.",GA,30349,None,Consent provided,Web,04/02/25,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,12779326

On XX/XX/XXXX, my father, the borrower of a Parent PLUS loan for my college education, passed away. The loan, managed by Nelnet, was eligible for discharge upon his death, per federal student loan rules. His death certificate was sent to the company after grieving, however there was a problem with the discharge that I was not made aware of. Automatic payments continued to be withdrawn from my personal bank account, which I had linked to the loan years earlier to help my father with payments, and I didn't notice them amongst the other student loan payments that were under my name. Between XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX, I paid a total of {$9100.00} on the loan, despite it being dischargeable.

I have screenshots of the withdrawals from my bank account and the servicers receipts confirming these payments, which I can provide. The loan was discharged on XX/XX/XXXX, but the servicer did not refund the payments I made after my fathers death. I contacted Nelnet multiple times to remedy this. On XX/XX/XXXX, I requested a refund of the {$9100.00}, explaining that I paid from my account unknowingly on a discharged loan. They denied my request to refund the bank account being drawn from because they said it had to be sent to the estate despite the funds not being drawn from my late father 's estate. They sent a check which can not be cashed, but this is not a sufficient solution.

These payments were not my legal obligation, as I was not the borrower, and my fathers estate is closed with no assets. The {$9100.00} overpayment has caused me financial strain.

Despite my loan balance being in deferment, the balance has increased from approximately {$46000.00} to {$48000.00}, indicating that interest was improperly applied during this period. This constitutes a direct violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ), which requires credit reporting agencies to maintain maximum possible accuracy in their reporting.

Violation of Federal Laws and Privacy Protections 1. Improper Accrual of Interest During Deferment My student loan has been in deferment, during which no interest should have accrued on a federally subsidized loan. 
The reported balance increase indicates a clear error, violating federal regulations governing student loan deferment. 
2. Failure to Notify of Deferment Ending or Interest Accrual I never received any written or electronic notification that my student loans would exit deferment or that interest would begin accruing.

This failure to notify is a violation of the Higher Education Act of 1965, which mandates proper borrower notification.

3. Unauthorized Disclosure and Mishandling of Personal Financial Information My personal financial information was compromised without my authorization, a direct violation of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act ( FERPA ), 20 U.S.C. 1232g, 34 CFR Part 99. 
Additionally, the XXXX data breach exposed sensitive information of millions of consumers, including myself, further contributing to these inaccuracies. 

The CFPB has ongoing litigation against XXXX and XXXX for systemic failures in protecting consumer data, including inaccuracies in credit reporting and mishandling sensitive information. Given the scope of these violations and the continuing harm caused by XXXX XXXX data breach, I am formally requesting inclusion in any class-action lawsuit related to these violations. 

The XXXX data breach resulted in millions of consumers personally identifiable information ( PII ) being compromised, including mine. This breach not only exposed my data but also created ongoing risks of identity theft, unauthorized access, and inaccurate reporting of financial information, all of which are directly tied to the current inaccuracies in my credit report.

1. Permanent Removal of All Student Loan Accounts from My Credit Report Due to these documented violations, the continued reporting of my student loan balance constitutes furnishing inaccurate and unverifiable information, prohibited under 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ).

Under 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 5 ) ( A ), if this information can not be verified within five ( 5 ) business days, it must be permanently deleted.

2. Immediate Full Discharge and Cancellation of My Federal Student Loans Due to the unauthorized access, breach of security, and failure to properly notify me of my loan status, my loan agreement is legally void.

Violations of FERPA, Title IV of the Higher Education Act, and the Privacy Act of 1974 ( 5 U.S.C. 552a ) support the immediate discharge of this loan.

3. Recognition and Inclusion in Any Class-Action Lawsuit I formally request to be included as a claimant in any class-action lawsuit involving : The CFPBs ongoing case against XXXX and XXXX. 
The XXXX data breach settlement or any subsequent litigation regarding inaccurate credit reporting and mishandling of sensitive information. 

I am not requesting a fraud alert but have already secured my credit information by freezing my reports. Due to the urgency of this matter, I require a written response within five ( 5 ) business days detailing the corrective actions being taken.

Failure to comply will result in immediate escalation, including formal complaints with : The Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) for FCRA violations.

In the meantime, due to the processing pause on XXXX applications, their website had a notification that said, "" If you have an IDR application that has not been processed within XXXX days and have an unpaid bill within XXXX days of the due date, MOHELA will automatically place a processing forbearance as directed by Federal Student Aid to your account. No action is required by you. '' This applies to me. So I was waiting for my loans to be put into forbearance but they never were. My bill was well over ten days past due, and still nothing. I paid the bill out of fear for my credit score, but this is completely unacceptable. If no action is required by me, why am I having to message them twice about it ( on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX ) only for nothing to happen? I have sent them five messages total ( on XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX ) about this whole fiasco, and have never had a helpful response, if I received one at all. The three responses I have gotten ( the dates of which I'm unsure of because they don't contain a timestamp, which at this point feels purposeful and malicious ) have been an obviously copy and pasted default answer in response to the words "" XXXX '' or "" forbearance '' and do not at all relate to my specific questions and situation. I've also tried calling, but have never been able to connect with a real person, just an unhelpful robot. I work full time and I don't have time to sit on hold for hours on end. I submitted a complaint to XXXX, who said they would respond within XXXX  days, but today is day XXXX and I have reached my limit of what I'm willing to deal with. This is the absolute worst company I have every had the displeasure of working with. Their customer service is non-existent, and they do not follow through with the claims they make on their website. The stakes here are very high, and they continue to drop the ball and they can not be trusted. I can no longer find the notification on their website about the XXXX application that hasn't been processed in XXXX days. It's been replaced with one that says "" Borrows that have a pending IDR application may also be placed on a forbearance until no later than XX/XX/XXXX. '' So which one is it? They can not claim to be automatically putting loans into forbearance in one notification, and then say that it's only a possibility in another one. I'm glad I took a screen shot of the first notification, otherwise I wouldn't have any proof of this. I understand that this is a stressful and uncertain time for federal loans, but it is completely unacceptable to leave me in this situation.",Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law,MOHELA,IL,60126,None,Consent provided,Web,03/30/25,Closed with explanation,No,N/A,12730667

03/26/25,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Trouble with how payments are being handled,"Subject : Formal Complaint Against MOHELA for Credit Reporting Violations and Negligence I am submitting this formal complaint to report negligent loan servicing, a failure of communication, and an unjust credit reporting incident by MOHELA. 

On or about XX/XX/year>, I was alerted to a XXXX XXXX XXXX drop due to a reported delinquency by MOHELAwithout ever receiving notice of the debt, a bill, or communication. Their failure to update my contact information from over a decade ago and refusal to acknowledge the issue constitutes gross negligence.

I applied for PSLF and was told by the Department of Education that my file was complete. It has been confirmed that I met the qualifications for forgiveness. MOHELA failed to process this correctly and failed to prevent unjust damage to my credit standing. 

A MOHELA representative named XXXX admitted during a recorded call that he agreed with my position and would have reversed the credit damage had it been within his discretion. Despite this, no action was taken. Furthermore, I was prepared to make immediate full payment of the past-due balance if my credit was restoredan offer which was dismissed. I was instead advised to use a 35-month forbearance period that I had never been informed of, a fact that alone suggests the delinquency could have been entirely avoided had the servicer properly communicated. 

I demand that the CFPB launch an investigation into MOHELAs handling of this situation and their broader pattern of credit-damaging practices as echoed by countless others online. Their behavior contradicts federal credit reporting law and fair servicing protocols. 


I am a responsible borrower and property owner. This action by MOHELA has created undue hardship and must be resolved immediately.

04/16/25,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Incorrect information on your report,Account status incorrect,"I am submitting this complaint regarding the credit reporting practices of Nelnet, my previous federal student loan servicer. My loans have since been transferred to a new servicer, XXXX and the accounts are currently in Administrative Forbearance, with no payments due until XX/XX/XXXX and all accounts paid up and in good standing. 

During my time with Nelnet, I did fall behind on payments in XX/XX/XXXX. However, I believe the resulting credit damage is severely disproportionate, and the transition was poorly communicated, creating confusion about my loan status and available options. 

First, Nelnet has a documented history of consumer complaints related to poor communication, lack of transparency during delinquency, and unclear servicing practices, especially during periods of account transition. In my case, I was not informed clearly or promptly that my loans were being transferred, nor was I provided consistent information about whether payments were still due or whether forbearance or deferment options were available. 

After the transfer to XXXX, the accounts were placed into Administrative Forbearance, and no payments are currently required. Despite this, my credit reports still reflect dozens of 90-day late payment entries reported by Nelnet, one for each individual loan, even though the loans are no longer delinquent and have not entered default. 

I believe this reporting violates the principles of fair and accurate credit reporting, and does not reflect the current status of the account. While the technical reporting may be accurate from Nelnets perspective, the outcome for me as a borrower is deeply harmful and inconsistent with the spirit of federal student loan policy, especially when my accounts are now current and in government-sanctioned forbearance. 

I have attached a screenshot from my loan servicer portal showing the Administrative Forbearance status and the fact that no payment is due.

They are not excluded from any federal statutes I. XXXX XXXX of XXXX as a XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX although often referred to as a student loan servicer, is not the original creditor for most federal and private loans it services. When loans are originated by the Department of Education or a private lender and later transferred to XXXX, it becomes a third-party loan servicer a distinction with significant legal consequences. The legal classification of XXXX is not unlike that of a debt collector when it services or collects debts not originally extended by itself, per 15 U.S.C. 1692a ( 6 ). 

Further, any debt that has been sold or assigned to XXXX must be supported by an unbroken and legally verifiable chain of title, as established under UCC 9-406, UCC 3-301 , and relevant federal case law. Absent such legal documentation, XXXX lacks standing to collect or enforce the debt in question. 

XXXX. Legal Violations by XXXX Assuming the debt has been sold, XXXX, or otherwise extinguished, any attempt by XXXX to collect constitutes a series of violations under both federal and state laws, including but not limited to : A. Violation of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ) : 1. 15 U.S.C. 1692e False or Misleading Representations : If XXXX continues to collect on a debt that has been sold, settled, or legally discharged, and fails to disclose that it is no longer the creditor or servicer with authority, it engages in deceptive practices.

2. 15 U.S.C. 1692g Failure to Validate Debt : XXXX is legally obligated to validate the debt within five days of initial contact, including the name of the original creditor and a breakdown of the debt. Failure to comply invalidates the legitimacy of the collection.

3. 15 U.S.C. 1692f Unfair Collection Practices : Continuing to attempt collection without a valid, enforceable interest in the loan constitutes unfair and unconscionable conduct. 

B. Violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) : If XXXX is reporting this debt to credit reporting agencies without the legal authority to do so, and after the debt has been transferred, discharged, or extinguished, it violates 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2, which prohibits the furnishing of inaccurate or outdated information to consumer reporting agencies.

C. Violation of State Consumer Protection Statutes : Most states ( e.g., Californias Rosenthal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act or New Yorks Debt Collection Procedures Law ) mirror or exceed FDCPA protections. XXXX must be in compliance with the relevant state-specific provisions, including licensure, consumer notice, and verification obligations. 

D. Lack of Legal Standing Under the UCC : Under Uniform Commercial Code 3-301, only a holder in due course may enforce a negotiable instrument. XXXX must prove it is legally entitled to enforce the debt, with documented assignment and authorization. The absence of such renders all collection efforts unenforceable as a matter of law. 



XXXX. Rejection of Feudal or Quasi-Governmental XXXX XXXX is a publicly traded private corporation, not a federal agency, and it does not enjoy sovereign authority or immunity. Although it may be contracted by the U.S. Department of Education, it is not a fiduciary arm of the government, and as such, it is fully subject to civil liability under FDCPA, FCRA, and other statutes. This precludes any claim of sovereign protection or implied enforcement authority. Its operations are commercial in nature, and governed accordingly by contract law, consumer protection laws, and commercial codes.

IV. Legal Demand for Immediate Erasure of Debt and Remedial Action Given that : The debt has been sold or otherwise transferred ; XXXX has not proven legal standing to enforce it ; The debt may have been discharged or forgiven ; Continued attempts to collect constitute violations of multiple federal and state statutes ; It is hereby demanded that all efforts to collect or report this debt cease immediately, and that the account be permanently removed from all consumer credit reports pursuant to 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ).

Failure to comply will result in formal complaints to the : Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) State Attorney Generals Office and may result in civil litigation
seeking injunctive relief, statutory damages, and attorneys fees under 15 U.S.C. 1692k.

Before consolidating my loans, I had a principal balance of {$260000.00} and {$20000.00} in accrued interest. That interest was capitalized and added to the principal during consolidation, raising my balance significantly. I was never clearly informed that this would occur.

During the lengthy processing period of my consolidation application, an additional {$5500.00} in interest accrued by the time I was placed in the SAVE program. I did not receive proper disclosure that interest would accumulate during this time. I called several times, and multiple representatives apologized for the misinformation. This is in the call logs. 

In XX/XX/year>, I submitted my IDR recertification. Shortly after, I received a letter from Nelnet stating that my loans would be placed in forbearance and would not accrue interest during this time.

This breach constitutes a direct violation of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act ( FERPA ) and Title IV regulations, as well as an egregious violation of my personal privacy and financial security. 
I recently discovered that my sensitive and legally protected records were accessed and potentially shared without my consent. This includes but is not limited to : 1.My academic records and personally identifiable information ( PII ). 
2.My Free Application for Federal Student Aid ( FAFSA ) data, including financial aid history and loan information. 
3.My IRS tax transcripts, which were obtained and used without proper authorization. 
These actions violate my rights under FERPA ( 20 U.S.C. 1232g ; 34 CFR Part 99 ), which grants me the right to control access to my educational records, as well as Title IV of the Higher Education Act, which governs the use and protection of federal student aid information. Furthermore, unauthorized access to my IRS tax data raises serious concerns regarding potential identity theft, fraud, and violations of federal data security standards. 
Given the severity of this breach and the direct impact on my financial security and privacy, I demand the following corrective actions : 1.Immediate discharge and cancellation of all my federal student loans due to the breach of my financial aid and tax records, which invalidates the integrity of my loan agreements. 
2.A formal investigation into this data breach, including details on how my records were accessed, who accessed them, and for what purpose. 
3.A full report on the extent of my data exposure and the corrective measures being implemented to prevent future violations. 
4.Immediate notification to all major credit bureaus ( XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX place a fraud alert and investigate any unauthorized activity that may have resulted from this breach.

04/30/25,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Received bad information about your loan,"I have XXXX XXXX  that are in the process of being discharged due to misconduct by my school. This process is called borrowers defense, and applies to my loans from the XXXX XXXX. I have attached the emails regarding notification of this matter. According to the Department of Education and Nelnet, this process can take many years. In addition, there is no where I can go as the borrower to see the progress or status of this process. During this process, there should be no negative consequences or impact on me as the borrower. Part of the process for the discharge is a refund of all payments made towards the loans. Due to multiple changes in servicers over the years and the fact that my loans were consolidated, there was very little information available about the specifics of these loans from the very beginning of the process. I previously asked Nelnet in late XXXX for a record of all payments and loans- and I was told at that time that the information was unavailable due to the processing of the borrowers defense case. They did inform me that I would be getting a refund of approximately {$600.00}, which is the full amount they said I paid on these loans in over 10 years. I had serious doubts about that amount, but had XXXX recourse to prove otherwise. They informed me that the payment would be coming from the XXXX Treasury and provided instructions on how to sign up for direct deposit through the IRS website. I enrolled in direct deposit, and on XX/XX/XXXX, I received a deposit in the amount of {$690.00} from the XXXX Treasury. Due to not expecting any other payment, I contacted Nelnet and they confirmed that this is the refund for my borrowers defense case. They informed me that the Department of Education would be sending correspondence to confirm this, but nothing was received. I had spent another few hours at this point between calling Nelnet and the Department of Education, and I let it all go assuming itd all be made clear when the process was complete. 

I enrolled in school for the winter of XXXX ( XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX ) with no issues, and all loans were put into a forbearance status due to being a XXXX XXXX XXXX. I was eligible for financial aid at this point. I took the next semester off, and began the process to enroll for XXXX XXXX. I am going to a different school, so I had to login to update my XXXX form at the beginning of XX/XX/XXXX. Upon logging into the Department of Education, there was a bold warning about my loans being in default. I immediately contacted the Department of Education - because my loans are absolutely not in default and even if they were, there is absolutely no way they could go from good standing in XX/XX/XXXX to default in XX/XX/XXXX due to the amount of time needed to get into a default status. The Department of Education informed me that Nelnet, as the servicer, of these loans is solely responsible for updating loan status. I was told to contact Nelnet. Upping logging into the Nelnet website, there is no information about any late payments, default status or record of the defaulted loans. They are not even reported on my loan history. I called Nelnet, and I was informed that the process of refunding payments during a loan discharge can put the loan into a erroneous status of default. They informed me that there was nothing they could do about this, and I had to wait for the borrowers defense case to be resolved and all information would be updated and made right at that time. I requested a supervisor, who reiterated that there was nothing they could do and that this was just part of the process. I informed them that due to being in a default status, I can not return to school and obtain XXXX XXXX, and there are serious consequences to my credit report. In addition, when the government returns to wage garnishments in XX/XX/XXXX, my wages will be garnished for a defaulted loan that I dont owe. Nelnet again told me they had no solution, and that I just had to wait. They were unable to provide any specific timeline, but did inform me that it will likely be a year or more before any update is made to my account. They informed me that this is because the Department of Education controls all processing and they generally take 3-5 years in total for a borrowers defense case. 

I filed a complaint with the XXXX Department of Education to attempt to resolve this matter in early XX/XX/XXXX, however there has been no resolution to date. I have attached records of my Nelnet account, Department of Education account, deposit of refund, and original emails informing me of approval of my borrowers defense case.

On XXXX XXXX I contact nelnet at XXXX eastern time to discuss the matter. At this time I explained to the advisor the same thing I explained above. She stated the bank returned payment. I asked why I was not informed of the matter prior to this phone call on XX/XX/XXXX. She states shes not sure but I would be able to make a payment now to ensure my account is in good standings. At this time I did make a payment and I did receive another confirmation email stating that the payment effective date would be XX/XX/XXXX and would not reflect on my account as past due. Today I open up the nelnet app to ensure everything is going accordingly and I notice that my new payment states that I owe XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX and that there is a late payment of XXXX. I called nelnet again to speak about the matter.. I was told dont worry about it it wont reflect on your credit report unless its 90 days past due at this time it is only one day past due again I made the payment and i spoke with an advisor who also stated my payment would not reflect a late payment as the effective date would be the due date and I had nothing to worry about.

Key Issues : Misrepresentation of Refund Impact on Loan Forgiveness : In XX/XX/XXXX, EdFinancial explicitly told me I could request a refund of payments made during the COVID-19 forbearance period without affecting my eligibility for student loan forgiveness.

Relying on this, I requested and received a refund of {$14000.00} in XX/XX/XXXX. 

I had already fully paid off my loan in XXXX, believing my financial obligations were settled. 

I was never informed that accepting the refund would reinstate my loan balance or accrue additional interest.

Unfair and Deceptive Practices : Despite being assured my loan forgiveness eligibility was unaffected, my balance was reinstated, now totaling {$15000.00} with added interest.

Had I been properly informed of the consequences, I would not have proceeded with the refund.

Mishandling and Lack of Transparency : EdFinancial claimed my loan records from XXXX were lost due to a server overhaul. 

For years, I sought clarification but was ignored. Only after I escalated my complaint to CFPB and provided bank records did EdFinancial acknowledge the issue that lead to an unsatisfactory result.

05/09/25,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Received bad information about your loan,"I was a full-time student with my federal loans in deferment, serviced by Edfinancial. I recently discovered that my Direct Unsubsidized Loans had accrued over {$4000.00} in interest during that periodwithout a single statement, alert, or proactive communication informing me that this was happening. 

I understand that unsubsidized loans accrue interest during deferment. However, I believe it was negligent for Edfinancial to allow years of interest to build up without providing any regular account updates or balance change notifications. Other types of lenders ( credit card, auto loan, mortgage ) are required to issue statements regardless of payment due, and student loan servicers should be held to the same basic transparency standards. 

Had I been notified, I would have made interest-only payments and avoided thousands in added debt. Instead, I was left unaware until after the interest had accrued significantly. This lack of communication caused real financial harm, and I believe it reflects a broader issue in student loan servicing that deserves regulatory attention.

04/09/25,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Problem with fraud alerts or security freezes,None,"Im filing this complaint against XXXX due to severe and unjustified negative credit reporting that has significantly impacted my financial standing. My credit report was recently updated to reflect over 20 late payment entries from DEPT OF ED/ XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX VA XXXX which has caused my credit score to drop by over XXXX points. This action was taken without any prior notice, warning, or correspondenceI did not receive any emails, letters, or alerts informing me of this drastic change before it was reported to the credit bureaus.

Additionally, I have become aware of an ongoing data breach involving student loan accounts, which raises serious concerns regarding unauthorized access to my personal and financial information raising concerns over a FERPA violation. Given this security lapse, I have reason to believe that my account records may have been compromised or altered without my consent.

I am in the process of purchasing a home and this has caused my loan to be halted until this is remedied. This has caused extreme financial distress and this error in reporting needs to be remedied immediately. I did not authorize any changes to my account status, and I no longer feel comfortable having my student loans serviced and reported to the credit bureaus under these conditions.

Violations and Consumer Protection Rights 1. Failure to Provide Notice of Negative Credit Reporting - Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), loan servicers are required to provide accurate and fair reporting. I was not notified in advance that these accounts would be marked late, which denied me the opportunity to address any potential issues before they were reported.

2. Possible Unauthorized Reporting and Account Compromise Due to Data Breach - The reported
data breach involving XXXX raises serious questions about the integrity of my loan accounts. If my data was exposed or manipulated, XXXX may have incorrectly or fraudulently reported late payments that I did not actually incur.

3. Failure to Properly Investigate and Verify Account Status - Given the security risks and errors in reporting, I request full verification and documentation proving the legitimacy of the late payments, including a detailed account history showing how and when they were marked late.

Requested Resolution - Immediate removal of all reported late payments from my credit report, as they were reported without proper notice and under potentially compromised circumstances.

- A formal investigation into reporting of DEPT OF ED/ XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX VA XXXX practices to determine whether my data was mishandled or compromised. 

- A written response from DEPT OF ED/ XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX VA XXXX confirming the deletion of these late payments from my credit file. This situation has caused me extreme distress, financial harm, and damage to my creditworthiness.

- I expect a prompt and thorough resolution in compliance with federal consumer protection laws.

Despite assurances that my claim would be reviewed and I would be contacted, neither happens unless I follow up. I am now calling every month or two to follow upwhile my loan accrues interest on money I dont actually owe. Each time I call, and the last two times was with a supervisor, I am told that they will contact me as soon as they know more.

04/09/25,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Problem with customer service,"NOTICE This Complaint Is Not a Duplicate : Any Attempt to Misclassify It Constitutes Procedural Misrepresentation and Regulatory Misconduct ========================================================================= This complaint is not a duplicate of any prior submission, including but not limited to CFPB Complaint ID XXXX. It documents a new, independently reportable violationspecifically, Aidvantages continued misrepresentation of a prior CFPB complaint filed against XXXX ( ID XXXX ) as the basis for its internal fraud classification, as well as its stated policy of collapsing multiple complaints into a single response record. 
========================================================================= Any attempt by Aidvantage to mischaracterize this complaint as previously addressed or duplicative will be treated as a fraudulent procedural act and a misuse of the federal consumer complaint system, in violation of : 12 U.S.C. 5536 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( B ) Prohibition on deceptive and abusive acts or practices ( UDAAP ) ; 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( B ) Furnishers duty to correct and update inaccurate information ; D.C. Code 28-3904 ( e ), ( f ) Misrepresentation and failure to honor consumer rights under the D.C. Consumer Protection Procedures Act ; 18 U.S.C. 1001 Material false statements to a federal agency or in a matter within federal jurisdiction. 
========================================================================= This complaint arises from a new, post-dated violation that took place after prior complaints were filed. It involves a materially false assertion made by Aidvantage in its XX/XX/2025 response, falsely linking a separate CFPB complaint ( filed against XXXX ) to its internal servicing records, and reaffirming a pattern of improper fraud designation and procedural concealment. 
========================================================================= Furthermore, Aidvantages stated policy of responding to multiple complaints under one CFPB complaint number constitutes an attempt to suppress individualized complaint visibility, obstruct the official regulatory record, and evade accountability for ongoing and distinct legal violations. 
========================================================================= Any further attempt by Aidvantage to mislabel this submission as duplicative or to suppress its factual and legal claims through internal aggregation policies will be preserved as evidence of regulatory misconduct and will be escalated as warranted. 
========================================================================= NOTICE : Aidvantages continued misuse of the CFPBs complaint designation system to obscure procedural violations is being independently tracked as part of an active evidentiary dossier for potential regulatory enforcement and civil litigation, if warranted. 
========================================================================= Subject : Systemic Misrepresentation by Aidvantage False Identity Theft Designation, Unauthorized Use of CFPB Complaint Record, and Violation of Federal Furnisher Obligations ========================================================================= To : Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, FTC ========================================================================= CC : Aidvantage Credit Bureau Management ========================================================================= Date : XX/XX/2025 ========================================================================= Complainant : XXXX XXXX XXXX ========================================================================= Complaint ID Referenced ( for background ) : ========================================================================= XXXX ========================================================================= XXXX ========================================================================= XXXX ========================================================================= XXXX ========================================================================= Affirmation of Independent Legal Action and Federal Record Accuracy ========================================================================= I submit this complaint in my individual legal capacity and affirm that I am not affiliated with any credit repair organization. This submission documents federal loan servicing misconduct and preserves all rights for civil, regulatory, and evidentiary enforcement. Aidvantage is formally on notice. 
========================================================================= I. Unauthorized Identity Theft Designation of Federal Loan Account ========================================================================= Aidvantage unilaterally designated one or more of my federal student loan accounts as involving identity theft without my authorization, without law enforcement documentation, and without any identity theft report submitted by me. 
========================================================================= This act constitutes : ========================================================================= A material misrepresentation of the status of a federal student loan, ========================================================================= A falsification of servicing records, ========================================================================= A violation of FCRA 1681s-2 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( B ) and 12 U.S.C. 5536 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( B ) ( UDAAP ). 
========================================================================= I have submitted a notarized affidavit and two FTC Fraud Reports affirming no identity theft was reported. Aidvantage proceeded with a fraud designation despite this documentation. 
========================================================================= XXXX. Misuse of CFPB Complaint System to Justify Internal Fraud Protocol ========================================================================= In its XX/XX/2025 response, Aidvantage cited CFPB Complaint ID XXXX was filed against XXXX the basis for initiating a fraud classification on my federal loan. 
========================================================================= This claim is demonstrably false. 
========================================================================= The referenced complaint does not mention identity theft, was not submitted against Aidvantage, and was never intended as a fraud-related dispute. Aidvantages use of this record to trigger internal fraud protocols constitutes a misrepresentation in a federal proceeding and may violate : ========================================================================= 18 U.S.C. 1001 False statements to a federal agency, ========================================================================= 12 U.S.C. 5536 ( a ) ( 2 ) Misrepresentation to a consumer or regulator, ========================================================================= FCRA 1681s-2 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( B ) Furnisher duty to correct inaccurate information. 
========================================================================= III. Transmission or Attempted Transmission of False Identity Theft Information ========================================================================= Aidvantage has either transmitted or attempted to transmit this false identity theft classification to one or more consumer reporting agencies through E-Oscar or equivalent systems. 
========================================================================= This conduct violates : ========================================================================= FCRA 1681e ( b ) Failure to ensure maximum possible accuracy, ========================================================================= 12 C.F.R. 1022.42 Accuracy and Integrity Rule under FACTA, ========================================================================= CFPB Bulletin 2014-01 Prohibition on furnishing misleading or false information. 
XXXX Aidvantage has not produced documentation identifying the system or person responsible for triggering the fraud classification despite multiple formal requests. 
========================================================================= IV. Procedural Suppression of the Official Regulatory Record ========================================================================= Aidvantages statement that multiple complaints regarding the same concerns will be responded to under one CFPB complaint number reflects a policy of collapsing distinct complaints to limit regulatory exposure. 
========================================================================= This tactic obstructs the integrity of the Bureaus public complaint system. Each complaint filed documents new dates, new legal violations, and escalating conduct. Collapsing separate records may violate : ========================================================================= 12 U.S.C. 5495 CFPB coordination and supervisory authority requirements. 
========================================================================= This behavior appears designed to evade systemic accountability for recurring violations. 
========================================================================= V. Enforcement Referral and Legal Preservation ========================================================================= Pursuant to the Bureaus statutory mandate under 12 U.S.C. 5495 ( Coordination ), I formally request that this matter be referred for supervisory and enforcement review, and that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau coordinate with relevant federal and state agencies to ensure proper oversight, investigation, and legal remedy. 
========================================================================= The following agency referrals are warranted based on distinct legal authorities, each directly implicated by Aidvantages conduct : ========================================================================= 1. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) Enforcement Division ========================================================================= Aidvantages actions violate core provisions of the Fair Credit Reporting Act, including : ========================================================================= o 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( B ) : Duty of furnishers to correct and update inaccurate information.

========================================================================= o 15 U.S.C. 1681i : Failure to conduct a reasonable reinvestigation upon notice of dispute.

========================================================================= o 12 U.S.C. 5536 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( B ) : Prohibition on deceptive or abusive acts or practices under the Consumer Financial Protection Act ( UDAAP ).

========================================================================= These violations fall squarely within the CFPBs enforcement jurisdiction and implicate the agencys role in overseeing the accuracy and integrity of the credit reporting system.

========================================================================= 2. Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) ========================================================================= Aidvantages repeated misrepresentations to both consumer and regulatorparticularly its misuse of an unrelated CFPB complaint to justify a false fraud designationviolate the Federal Trade Commission Act, specifically : ========================================================================= o 15 U.S.C. 45 ( a ) : Prohibition on unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce. 
========================================================================= The FTC retains parallel jurisdiction over non-bank servicers and deceptive consumer-facing practices, and is positioned to investigate systemic misrepresentation or pattern violations. 
========================================================================= 3. Department of Justice ( DOJ ) Civil Division, Consumer Protection Branch ========================================================================= Aidvantages conduct may constitute federal offenses under : ========================================================================= a. 18 U.S.C. 1001 : False statements in matters within the jurisdiction of a federal agency.

========================================================================= b. 18 U.S.C. 1341 : Mail fraud, based on the use of USPS to transmit materially false information.

========================================================================= c. 18 U.S.C. 1343 : Wire fraud, where electronic systems ( including CFPB portal and E-Oscar transmissions ) were used to perpetuate misrepresentations. 

========================================================================= DOJ is authorized to initiate both civil and criminal proceedings where false statements or fraudulent schemes affect federal records or regulatory systems. 
========================================================================= 4. National Association of Attorneys General ( NAAG ) ========================================================================= Aidvantages conduct may violate multiple state-level consumer protection laws, including : ========================================================================= d. D.C. Consumer Protection Procedures Act ( CPPA ), D.C. Code 28-3904 ( e ), ( f ) : Prohibiting misrepresentation and omission of material facts in connection with consumer services. 

========================================================================= Given the multistate and federally regulated nature of the loan, a NAAG-coordinated review is appropriate under 5495s requirement for intergovernmental coordination to prevent regulatory evasion. 


========================================================================= All factual assertions, sworn affidavits, and certified documents are preserved in accordance with the Federal Rules of Evidence 902 and 1005. No further burden-shifting, misclassification, or procedural obfuscation by Aidvantage will be accepted. This matter now requires cross-agency supervisory action.
