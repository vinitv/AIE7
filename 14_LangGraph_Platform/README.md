# Build 🏗️

Run the repository and complete the following:

- 🤝 Breakout Room Part #1 — Building and serving your LangGraph Agent Graph
  - Task 1: Getting Dependencies & Environment
    - Configure `.env` (OpenAI, Tavily, optional LangSmith)
  - Task 2: Serve the Graph Locally
    - `uv run langgraph dev` (API on http://localhost:2024)
  - Task 3: Call the API
    - `uv run test_served_graph.py` (sync SDK example)
  - Task 4: Explore assistants (from `langgraph.json`)
    - `agent` → `simple_agent` (tool-using agent)
    - `agent_helpful` → `agent_with_helpfulness` (separate helpfulness node)

- 🤝 Breakout Room Part #2 — Using LangGraph Studio to visualize the graph
  - Task 1: Open Studio while the server is running
    - https://smith.langchain.com/studio?baseUrl=http://localhost:2024
  - Task 2: Visualize & Stream
    - Start a run and observe node-by-node updates
  - Task 3: Compare Flows
    - Contrast `agent` vs `agent_helpful` (tool calls vs helpfulness decision)

<details>
<summary>🚧 Advanced Build 🚧 (OPTIONAL - <i>open this section for the requirements</i>)</summary>

- Create and deploy a locally hosted MCP server with FastMCP.
- Extend your tools in `tools.py` to allow your LangGraph to consume the MCP Server.
</details>

# Ship 🚢

- Running local server (`langgraph dev`)
- Short demo showing both assistants responding

# Share 🚀
- Walk through your graph in Studio
- Share 3 lessons learned and 3 lessons not learned


#### ❓ Question:

What is the purpose of the `chunk_overlap` parameter when using `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` to prepare documents for RAG, and what trade-offs arise as you increase or decrease its value?

##### ✅ Answer:
Purpose: Determines how much text overlaps between consecutive chunks when splitting documents.
Trade-offs:
- More overlap: Preserves context across boundaries but wastes storage and may retrieve duplicates
- Less overlap: Saves space and avoids redundancy but can break related concepts apart


#### ❓ Question:

Your retriever is configured with `search_kwargs={"k": 5}`. How would adjusting `k` likely affect RAGAS metrics such as Context Precision and Context Recall in practice, and why?

##### ✅ Answer:

Higher k (retrieve more chunks):
- Context Recall gets better - you're more likely to grab all the relevant info
- Context Precision gets worse - you'll also grab irrelevant stuff

Lower k (retrieve fewer chunks):
- Context Recall drops - you might miss important details
- Context Precision improves - you only get the most relevant chunks

It's basically a precision vs recall trade-off.


#### ❓ Question:

Compare the `agent` and `agent_helpful` assistants defined in `langgraph.json`. Where does the helpfulness evaluator fit in the graph, and under what condition should execution route back to the agent vs. terminate?

##### ✅ Answer:

The helpful version checks if responses are actually useful before finishing.

How it works:
- After the agent responds, a helpfulness checker evaluates the answer
- If the response is helpful, then terminates
- If unhelpful, loops back to try again
- Safety valve kicks in after 10 messages to prevent infinite loops

The helpfulness evaluator acts like a quality gate that sits between the agent's response and the final output.
