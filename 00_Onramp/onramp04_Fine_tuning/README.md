# Fine-Tuning Llama 3.1 8B: A Journey to Enhanced Reasoning

Welcome to today's session where we embark on the exciting journey of fine-tuning the Llama 3.1 8B model to enhance its reasoning capabilities!

## Why Choose PEFT and LoRA for Fine-Tuning?

Fine-tuning large language models like Llama 3.1 8B traditionally demands vast computational resources and memory, often inaccessible to many practitioners. This is where **Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT)** and **Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)** come into play. 

- **PEFT** allows us to fine-tune by adjusting only a small subset of parameters, introducing additional parameters that are trained while keeping the original model parameters fixed.
- **LoRA** innovatively freezes the original model weights and trains small, low-rank adapter matrices. This method reduces trainable parameters from billions to just millions (typically 0.1-1% of the original model), significantly cutting down on memory requirements and training time while maintaining comparable performance.

## Deep Dive: Fine-Tuning with PEFT and LoRA

In this lecture, we explore the nuances of fine-tuning large language models using PEFT and LoRA. This approach is particularly advantageous for adapting models like Llama 3.1 8B to specific tasks without the need for extensive computational resources.

### Key Concepts

- **Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT):** A method that allows for the fine-tuning of large models by only adjusting a small subset of parameters. This is achieved by introducing additional parameters that are trained while the original model parameters remain fixed.

- **Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA):** A technique that involves training low-rank matrices to adapt the model to new tasks. By focusing on these smaller matrices, LoRA significantly reduces the number of trainable parameters, making the process more efficient.

## Experience the Power of Google Colab

This notebook is designed to be run on **Google Colab**, offering free access to GPU resources essential for fine-tuning large language models. Google Colab's cloud-based environment eliminates the need for local GPU hardware and comes pre-installed with most of the required dependencies.
